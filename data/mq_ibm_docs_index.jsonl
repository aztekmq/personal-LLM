To set up your configuration for this scenario, complete the following steps:\n1. Install two copies of IBM MQ. In this example, they are named Inst_1 and Inst_2 .\n2. Make Inst_1 primary by running setmqinst .\n3. Associate all the queue managers on the server with Inst_1 by running setmqm .\n4. Start all the queue managers on the server.\nNote: From 1Q 2023, for Multiplatforms, there are two types of maintenance:\n• Fix packs, which contain roll-ups of all defects fixed since the previous fix pack delivery (or GA).\nFix packs are produced exclusively for Long Term Support (LTS) releases during their normal support\nlifecycle.\n• Cumulative security updates (CSUs), which are smaller updates and contain security patches released\nsince the previous maintenance (GA). CSUs are produced for LTS releases (including releases in\nextended support), and also for the latest IBM MQ Continuous Delivery (CD) release, as required to\ndeliver relevant security patches.\nFor maintenance releases in or after 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF represents either a fix pack\nnumber or a CSU number. Both types of maintenance are mutually cumulative (that is, they contain\neverything included in older CSUs and fix packs), and both are installed using the same mechanisms for\napplying maintenance. Both types of maintenance update the F-digit of the VRMF to a higher number than\nany previous maintenance: fix packs use \"F\" values divisible by 5, CSUs use \"F\" values not divisible by 5.\nFor maintenance releases before 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF always represents the fix pack\nlevel. For example, the first fix pack of the IBM MQ 9.3.0 LTS release is numbered 9.3.0.1.\nFor more information, see Changes to IBM MQ's maintenance delivery model .\nAbout this task\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ on a server to stage the release of IBM MQ maintenance level\nupdates. For example, as in the scenario that is described in the task steps, by using two installations\nto roll out maintenance level updates, you maintain two maintenance levels on a server, with the aim of\ngetting all queue managers and applications to the production maintenance level before replacing the\nprevious level of maintenance with the next level.\nWhich installation an application uses is driven by the queue manager that an application connects to.\nThe setmqm command associates a queue manager with an installation. You can associate a queue\nmanager with a different installation as long as the installation is at the same or higher command level.\nIn this scenario, all the installations are at the same command level.

Installation of new code on top of existing code. You might be able to roll back an upgrade applied\nin this way; it depends on the platform. Generally speaking, you cannot roll back the installation of\nnew code. To restore the old code level, you must retain the old installation media, and any fixes you\napplied.\n2. Removal of the old level of code, followed by installation of the new level. The installers on very few\nplatforms require you to remove an old installation first. Needless to say, to restore the old code level,\nyou must reinstall it and any fixes.\n3. Side by side installation.\n•\n On z/OS you can install different code levels alongside each other on the same server.\nIn the JCL to start a subsystem, you select the code level to use.\n•\n On AIX, Linux, and Windows, you associate a queue manager with an installation, and\nstart the queue manager. In IBM MQ, running multiple queue managers at different command levels\non the same server is termed queue manager coexistence.\nYou must not infer from this, that you can select different installations to run a queue manager at\ndifferent times. Once a queue manager has been run, it is subject to the rules regarding reverting to\nearlier or later command levels.\nNote: The term upgrade does not imply that an IBM MQ installation can be directly upgraded from\none level to another. On some platforms, an upgrade requires that you remove the previous IBM MQ\ninstallation. You can retain any queue managers that you have created.\nOn z/OS, reversibility of an upgrade has two parts; backout of the installation to the previous\ncode level, and reversion of any queue managers that have been started at the new code level, to work\nwith the previous code level again. See “Upgrade and migration of IBM MQ on z/OS ” on page 469 for\nmore information.\nThe rules regarding the reversibility of an queue manager to run on a previous code level is dependent on\nthe platform.\nOn the following platforms, changes in version, release, or modification level are not fully reversible, but\nchanges in fix level are reversible under certain conditions.\n•\n AIX\n•\n Linux\n•\n Windows\n•\n IBM i\nAn irreversible upgrade implies that you must back up the queue managers, or your system, before\nupgrading, to be able to restore your queue managers. Taking a backup of a queue manager requires you\nto stop the queue manager. If you do not take a backup, you are not able to restore IBM MQ to its previous\nlevel. Any changes you make on the new level cannot be restored onto the backup system. Changes\ninclude the creation or deletion of persistent messages, and changes to queue managers, channels,\ntopics, and queues.\nRelated concepts\n“Upgrade and migration of IBM MQ on z/OS ” on page 469\nYou can install new releases of IBM MQ to upgrade IBM MQ to a new release, version or modification\n(VRM) level.

Security rules might restrict the use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH .\n• Is the later version of the product installed alongside the earlier version?\n2. Identify the installation of the later version of the product, from which the operating system is going to\nload IBM MQ libraries:\n• If you have a multiple installations of the later versions to load from a server, IBM MQ checks that\nthe installation the library was loaded from is the installation that is associated with any queue\nmanager the application calls. IBM MQ loads the correct library if the wrong library is loaded. It is\nnecessary to configure only one runtime environment for all IBM MQ applications.\n• A typical choice is set the primary installation.

The definitions are\ndescribed here. The following sections describe the various concepts associated with migration, followed\nby the various tasks needed; these tasks are platform-specific where needed.\n“Applying maintenance to IBM MQ” on page 293\nMaintenance is the application of a reversible fix. Any changes to queue manager data are compatible\nwith the previous code level.\nC on fig uring and tuning the operating system on IBM i\nBefore installing IBM MQ for IBM i, there are several system values which need to be checked using the\nDSPSYSVAL command. If necessary, reset the values using the CHGSYSVAL command.\nCheck the following values and change if required:\nQCCSID\nEvery message has a coded-character set identifier (CCSID) in its header. The CCSID tag identifies the\ncode page and character set of the source.\nA queue manager obtains its CCSID from the job that created it. If the job CCSID is not a valid value\nin the range 1-65534, the queue manager uses the default CCSID value (65535) instead. You can\nchange the CCSID used by the IBM MQ queue manager by using the CL command CHGMQM .\nNote: The CCSID must be either single-byte character set (SBCS), or mixed, that is SBCS and DBCS. It\nmust not be DBCS only.\nQSYSLIBL\nEnsure that QSYS2 is included in the list of libraries that make up the system part of the library list.\nIBM MQ uses programs in this library for data conversion and SNA LU 6.2 communication.\nNote: Do not have QMQM as part of the system or user portion of the library list.\nQALWOBJRST\nEnsure that the QALWOBJRST system value is set to *ALL or *ALWPGMADP before you install MQ. If it\nis set to *NONE, installation fails.\nAfter installation, reset QALWOBJRST to its original value to maintain system security.\nQSHRMEMCTL\nEnsure that the QSHRMEMCTL system value is set to 1 (Allowed).\nA value of 1 is used in environments where pointers can be shared amongst programs between\ndifferent jobs.\nIBM MQ requires this setting to use the shared memory APIs shmat and shmget and to share its\npointers across jobs.\nIf it is not set correctly, initialization of IBM MQ fails with system return code \"3401\" (Permission\ndenied), and commands such as CRTMQM, STRMQM, ENDMQM, TRCMQM fail.\nQFRCCVNRST\nEnsure that the QFRCCVNRST system value is set to 0 (Restore all objects without conversion), or 1\n(Objects with validation errors are converted), before you install MQ. If it is not set, installation fails.\nQMLTTHDACN\nOptionally set this to control the generation of messages into joblogs. Set QMLTTHDACN to 2 to\nget messages generated in a joblog; set it to 1 to avoid the messages. For example, the message\nCPD000D is an informational message that is generated when a command that is not thread-safe is\nissued from a multi-threaded application. Setting QMLTTHDACN to 1 avoids the message.\nRelated concepts\n“Hardware and software requirements on IBM i systems” on page 65\nCheck that the server environment meets the prerequisites for installing IBM MQ for IBM i.\n“License requirements” on page 8\nInstalling and migrating   67"}

For example, a channel transmitting messages from a queue manager\ncalled QM27 to a queue manager called QM11 might be called QM27/QM11 .\nIf your network supports both TCP and SNA, you might also want to include the transport type in the\nchannel name, for example QM27/QM11_TCP .

This procedure can be used\nfor installing a first or a subsequent installation.\nAbout this task\nYou can use the Launchpad to make a compact, typical, or custom installation of IBM MQ. You can reuse\nthe launchpad multiple times to install further installations. It automatically selects the next available\ninstallation name, instance, and location to use. To view all the installation types and the features that are\ninstalled with each option, see “Installation methods for Windows” on page 170 .\nNote that if you have previously uninstalled IBM MQ from your system (see “Uninstalling IBM MQ on\nWindows” on page 224 ), some configuration information might remain, and some default values might be\nchanged.\nFrom IBM MQ 9.3.0, a new Confirm License Entitlement panel in the Windows interactive installer\nis presented after feature selection if you have chosen to install any IBM MQ Advanced features (MQ\nTelemetry Service, Advanced Message Security, or Managed File Transfer Service), or if you are upgrading\nfrom an installation that already has these features.\nThis panel simply warns you that these features are considered IBM MQ Advanced functionality and\nshould only be installed if you have entitlement to IBM MQ Advanced.

For installation into private file systems, IBM MQ can be installed directly into the System\nWPAR by using the procedure that is outlined in this topic. There are some limitations for shared /usr\nfile systems:\n– The dspmqinst and dspmqver commands might report the primary installation incorrectly when\ncompared with the symbolic links in /usr/bin . To synchronize the reporting of the primary\ninstallation in a System WPAR and the global environment, run setmqinst with the -i or -x\nparameter, on the individual zones.\n– You cannot change the primary installation within a WPAR. You must change the primary installation\nthrough the global environment, which has appropriate write access to /usr/bin .\nNote: During installation to a non-default location, ATTENTION messages that relate to errupdate or\ntrcupdate are produced. These messages are not errors. However, AIX system trace for IBM MQ is\nnot supported for installations in a non-default location, and IBM MQ trace must be used for problem\ndetermination.\n• If you install a copy of IBM MQ server for AIX by using a downloadable installation image , obtained from\nPassport Advantage, you need to:\n1. Decompress the tar file, by using the following command:\n uncompress IBM_MQ_9.4.0_AIX.tar.Z\n2. Extract the installation files from the tar file, by using the following command:\n tar -xvf IBM_MQ_9.4.0_AIX.tar\n3.

For more details, see Disk space requirements .\nCreating a file system for the working data\nBefore you install IBM MQ, create and mount a file system called /var/mqm which is owned by the user\nmqm in the group mqm ; see “Setting up the user and group on Linux” on page 99 . This file system is used\nby all installations of IBM MQ on a system. If possible, use a partition strategy with a separate volume\nfor the IBM MQ data. This means that other system activity is not affected if a large amount of IBM\nMQ work builds up. Configure the directory permissions to permit the mqm user to have full control, for\nexample, file mode 755. These permissions will then be updated during the IBM MQ installation to match\nthe permissions required by the queue manager.\nCreating separate file systems for errors and logs\nYou can also create separate file systems for your log data ( /var/mqm/log ) and error files ( /var/mqm/\nerrors ). If possible, place these directories on different physical disks from the queue manager data\n( /var/mqm/qmgrs ) and from each other.\nIf you create separate file systems the /var/mqm/errors directory can be NFS mounted. However, if\nyou choose to NFS-mount /var/mqm/errors , the error logs might be lost if the network fails.\nYou can protect the stability of your queue manager by having separate file systems for:\n•/var/mqm/errors\n•/var/mqm/trace\n•/var/mqm/qmgrs\n100   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

This is\nsupported so that you can migrate and test the upgrade of each queue manager.\nWhen you migrate queue managers in a queue sharing group, migrate all the queue managers to the new\nversion as quickly as you can. Queue sharing groups with queue managers at different versions are harder\nto administer than if all the queue managers are at the same version.\nBefore you migrate any member of a queue sharing group, you must upgrade the early code on each LPAR\nthat runs a member of the queue sharing group. The early code on each LPAR must be upgraded to the\nhighest level of IBM MQ that you are migrating to. For more information, see step “2” on page 474 of\n“Preparing to migrate a single IBM MQ for z/OS queue manager” on page 474 .\nMigrate each queue manager, one at a time, leaving the queue sharing group running. At no stage is an\noutage of the entire queue sharing group required.\nMigrating each queue manager comprises the bulk of the work of migrating a queue sharing group.\nApproach migrating a queue sharing group as requiring some extra tasks that must be completed during\nthe migration of each queue manager. These tasks are listed in “Migrating IBM MQ for z/OS - order of\ntasks” on page 473 as part of the procedure to migrate a single queue manager.\nA good approach is to create a migration plan that incorporates queue sharing group migration. For more\ninformation, see “Planning to migrate IBM MQ for z/OS to IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4” on page 471 .\nQueue managers that run at IBM MQ for z/OS 9.2. n, 9.3. n, and 9.4. n LTS and CD releases (where n is\ngreater than or equal to 0) can coexist in a queue sharing group.\nWhen you plan a migration, refer to Queue sharing group coexistence on z/OS to determine whether your\nqueue sharing group supports the migration of your queue manager.\nRelated reference\n“Queue sharing group coexistence on z/OS” on page 383\nQueue managers running on IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4, or any of the IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4.x Continuous\nDelivery (CD) releases, can be part of a QSG with queue managers running on IBM MQ for z/OS 9.2.0 or\n472   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

On z/OS, AIX, Linux, and Windows, different queue managers can coexist on the same server\nand be associated with different installations.\n“Multi-installation queue manager coexistence on AIX, Linux, and Windows” on page 376\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ for AIX, Linux, and Windows on the same server. These IBM MQ\ncopies can be at the same or different version levels. This is called a multi-installation. Multi-installation is\nparticularly useful when you upgrade from one IBM MQ version to a later version, because it allows you to\nrun the earlier version alongside the later version.\nRelated tasks\nAssociating a queue manager with an installation\nChanging the primary installation\nRelated reference\nsetmqenv\nsetmqinst\nsetmqm\nApplying maintenance level updates to multi-instance queue managers on\nAIX\nOn AIX, you can use multi-instance queue managers to reduce the outage caused by applying\nmaintenance updates.\nBefore you begin\nBefore starting this task, read through the prerequisites described in Before you begin in “Applying\nmaintenance level updates on AIX” on page 295 .\nBefore starting this task, see that the maintenance is applied to the IBM MQ installation on a server and\nnot to individual queue managers. Before you apply maintenance, you must stop all the queue managers,\nand any IBM MQ service, on a server.\nIf you want a queue manager to keep running while maintenance is applied, you must configure it as\na multi-instance queue manager, and have a standby instance running on another server. If the queue\nmanager that you want to keep running is an existing single instance queue manager, you must convert it\nto a multi-instance queue manager. For prerequisites and guidance how to create a multi-instance queue\nmanager, see Multi-instance queue managers .\nIf you are running multi-instance queue managers, you then can apply a maintenance update to a running\nqueue manager by switching the active instance to a different server.\nTypically, active and standby installations are maintained at the same maintenance level. Consult the\nmaintenance instructions for each update. Consult the instructions to see if it is possible to run the active\nand standby instances at different maintenance levels. Check whether fail over from higher to lower, or\nonly lower to higher maintenance level is possible.\nThe instructions for applying a maintenance update might require you to stop a multi-instance queue\nmanager completely.\n304   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

You\nmust run the wizard to configure the IBM MQ Service before you can start any queue managers.\nBefore you begin\nWhen IBM MQ is running, it must check that only authorized users can access queue managers or queues.\nWhenever any user attempts such access, IBM MQ uses its own local account to query information about\nthe user.\nMost networked Windows systems are members of a Windows domain where user accounts, other\nsecurity principals, and security groups are maintained and managed by a directory service, Active\nDirectory, running on a number of domain controllers. IBM MQ checks that only authorized users can\naccess queue managers or queues.\nIn such networks, IBM MQ queue manager processes access the Active Directory information to find the\nsecurity group membership of any users attempting to use IBM MQ resources. The accounts under which\nIBM MQ services run must be authorized to look up such information from the directory. In most Windows\ndomains, local accounts defined at individual Windows servers cannot access directory information, so\nthe IBM MQ services must run under a domain account that has the appropriate permission.\nIf the Windows server is not a member of a Windows domain or the domain has a reduced security\nor functional level, then the IBM MQ services can run under a local account that was created during\ninstallation.\nIf a special domain account is needed for your installation of IBM MQ, the Prepare IBM MQ Wizard asks\nyou to enter details of this account (domain, user name, and password), so make sure that you have\nthis information available before you start this task. Ask your domain administrator to set up an account,\nif one does not already exist, and provide you with the necessary details. For more information about\nconfiguring a domain account, see “Creating and setting up Windows domain accounts for IBM MQ” on\npage 196 .\nImportant: If a domain account is needed and you install IBM MQ without a special account (or without\nentering its details), many or all parts of IBM MQ will not work, depending on the particular user accounts\ninvolved. Also, IBM MQ connections to queue managers that run under domain accounts on other systems\nmight fail.

Single stage migration is also known as upgrading in place or in place upgrade .\nSingle-stage migration preserves existing scripts and procedures for running IBM MQ the most. With other\nmigration scenarios you might change some scripts and procedures, but you can reduce the effect queue\nmanager migration has on users.\nThe advantage of single-stage migration is that it changes the configuration of a queue manager on the\nearlier version as little as possible. Existing applications automatically switch from loading the libraries\nfrom the earlier version to loading the libraries of the later version. Queue managers are automatically\nassociated with the installation on the later version. Administrative scripts and procedures are affected as\nlittle as possible by setting the installation to be the primary installation. If you set the installation of the\nlater version to be the primary installation, commands such as strmqm work without providing an explicit\npath to the command.\nFor more information about performing a single-stage migration, see “Migrating on AIX and Linux: single-\nstage” on page 426 .\nSide-by-side migration\nSide-by-side migration is the term used to describe installing a later version of IBM MQ alongside\nan earlier version on the same server. Queue managers remain running during the installation and\nverification of the later version of IBM MQ. They remain associated with the earlier version of IBM\nMQ. When you decide to migrate queue managers to the later version of IBM MQ, you stop all queue\nmanagers, uninstall the earlier version, and migrate them all to the later version of IBM MQ.\nThe advantage the side-by-side scenario has over the single-stage scenario is that you can install and\nverify the installation of the later version of the product on the server before switching over to it.\nThe side-by-side migration scenario is less flexible than multi-stage migration, and might not seem to\nhave any advantages over it. However, side-by-side migration does have advantages over the multi-stage\nand single-stage approaches. With the side-by-side approach, because you uninstall the earlier version\nbefore starting any queue managers, you can assign an installation on the later version to be the primary\ninstallation. In the multi-stage approach, you cannot set an installation of the later version to be the\nprimary installation while you continue to run the earlier version. With the later version having the primary\ninstallation, many applications restart without reconfiguring their environment, making the migration\nprocess simpler.\nFor more information about performing a side-by-side migration, see “Migrating on AIX and Linux: side-\nby-side” on page 430 .\nMulti-stage migration\nMulti-stage migration is the term used to describe running a later version of IBM MQ alongside an earlier\nversion on the same server. After installing the later version alongside the earlier version, you can create\nnew queue managers to verify the installation of the later version, and develop new applications. At the\nsame time, you can migrate queue managers and their associated applications from the earlier version\nto the later version. By migrating queue managers and applications one-by-one, you can reduce the peak\nworkload on staff managing the migration. When migration to the later version is complete, you can\nuninstall the earlier version, and make the later version installation the primary installation.\nFor more information about performing a multi-stage migration, see “Migrating on AIX and Linux: multi-\nstage” on page 434 .\nBacking up and restoring a queue manager\nIBM MQ release types and versioning\nMigrating on AIX and Linux: single-stage\nSingle-stage migration is the term that is used to describe replacing the only installation of IBM MQ on a\nserver with a later release.

For download links for the Program Directories, see IBM\nMQ for z/OS Program Directory PDF files .\nThe Program Directory includes not only details of the installation process, but also information about the\nprerequisite products and their service or maintenance levels.\nSMP/E, used for installation on the z/OS platform, validates the service levels and prerequisite and\ncorequisite products, and maintains the SMP/E history records to record the installation of IBM MQ for\nz/OS. It loads the IBM MQ for z/OS libraries and checks that the loads have been successful. You then\nhave to customize the product to your own requirements.\nBefore you install and customize IBM MQ for z/OS, you must decide the following:\n• Whether you are going to install one of the optional national language features. See National language\nsupport .\n• Which communications protocol and distributed queuing facility you are going to use. See\nCommunications protocol and distributed queuing .\n• What your naming convention for IBM MQ objects will be. See Naming conventions .\n• What command prefix string (CPF) you are going to use for each queue manager. See Using command\nprefix strings .\n• When upgrading from a previous Continuous Delivery release through the installation of PTFs, decide\nwhether any USERMODs that have been applied to IBM MQ for z/OS will still be required. Remove the\nUSERMODs before installation of the Continuous Delivery PTFs, or use the SMP/E BYPASS(ID) option on\nAPPLY. If neither of these actions is performed, an SMP/E MODID ERROR GIM38201E will be received.\nThe PTFs for the latest Continuous Delivery release can be determined by using SMP/E FIXCAT\nHOLDDATA category IBM.MQ.V9 RMn, where R is the release number, and n is the modification level.\nFor example, category IBM.MQ.V9R0M2 identifies fixes that upgrade IBM MQ for z/OS 9.0 Continuous\nDelivery to modification level 2.\nYou also need to plan how much storage you require in your z/OS system to accommodate IBM MQ;\nPlanning your storage and performance requirements on z/OS helps you plan the amount of storage\nrequired.\n268   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

However, this severely limits the benefits of redistribution.\nThe redistributable package on the Windows platform does not provide any tooling to register DLLs with\nthe GAC, so .NET applications have to locate the appropriate assemblies by other means. There are two\noptions that work in this situation.\nProbing\nAfter checking the GAC, the .NET runtime attempts to locate required assemblies through probing. The\nfirst location checked is the application base, which is the root location where the application is being\nrun. See the information on How the Runtime Locates Assemblies on the Microsoft Web site for more\ninformation.\nNote that when using this approach, the maintenance level of the assemblies used when building\nthe .NET application must match those used at runtime - for example an application built at IBM MQ\n8.0.0 Fix Pack 4 must be run with the IBM MQ 8.0.0 Fix Pack 4 redistributable client runtime.\nUsing this approach, a .NET application placed in the \\bin directory alongside the IBM MQ assemblies\npicks up assemblies from a primary IBM MQ installation (if one exists), falling back to the redistributable\ncopies.\nInstalling and migrating   231"}

It tolerates them, but does not store them.\nIBM MQ MQI client migration\nMigrating a client configuration following installation of a new version or release of the IBM MQ MQI\nclient ; see “IBM MQ MQI client migration” on page 363 .\nIt is better to migrate the clients after the queue managers that they communicate with have been\nmigrated.\nApplication migration\nRelinking, recompiling, or recoding an IBM MQ server or client application; see “Application migration\nand interoperation” on page 364 . Application migration also includes migrating any API or channel\nexits.\nUse the new version of the libraries to build the applications, once the queue managers have been\nupgraded.\nImpact of migration on other queue managers or clients\nIn addition, you must consider the impact of migrating one queue manager, or IBM MQ MQI client, on\nother queue managers or clients:\nCompatibility, coexistence, and interoperability\nSee “Coexistence, compatibility, and interoperability” on page 372 for information about the\ncompatibility of IBM MQ applications connected to queue managers and IBM MQ MQI client clients on\ndifferent command levels. The section also explains the concept of queue manager coexistence, and\nthe interoperability of IBM MQ JMS applications with WebSphere Application Server.\nQueue manager clusters\nCan a queue manager cluster contain queue managers at different command levels? See “Migrating a\nqueue manager cluster” on page 485 to answer this question, and how to migrate a cluster of queue\nmanagers.\nQueue sharing groups\nQueue sharing groups involve multiple queue managers running on z/OS. How do you migrate queue\nmanagers that are part of a queue sharing group to a new command level? See “Queue sharing group\nmigration” on page 472 .\n358   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

However, if you choose to take advantage of\nmulti-installation in the later version of the product, based on the side-by-side or multi-stage migration\nscenarios, you might have to configure the runtime environment differently, for the operating system to\nload the later version of the IBM MQ library.\n“Multi-installation queue manager coexistence on AIX, Linux, and Windows” on page 376\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ for AIX, Linux, and Windows on the same server. These IBM MQ\ncopies can be at the same or different version levels. This is called a multi-installation. Multi-installation is\nparticularly useful when you upgrade from one IBM MQ version to a later version, because it allows you to\nrun the earlier version alongside the later version.\nsetmqenv\nsetmqinst\nsetmqm\nMigrating on AIX and Linux: multi-stage\nMulti-stage migration is the term used to describe running a later version of IBM MQ alongside an earlier\nversion on the same server. After installing the later version alongside the earlier version, you can create\nnew queue managers to verify the installation of the later version, and develop new applications. At the\nsame time, you can migrate queue managers and their associated applications from the earlier version\nto the later version. By migrating queue managers and applications one-by-one, you can reduce the peak\nworkload on staff managing the migration. When migration to the later version is complete, you can\nuninstall the earlier version, and make the later version installation the primary installation.\nBefore you begin\n1. The upgrade from the earlier version to the latest version of the product requires a full migration of\nqueue managers. Create a migration plan. Use the planning task “Planning to migrate IBM MQ to a\nlater version on AIX and Linux” on page 424 , as a guide.\n2. Review the IBM MQ system requirements for the later version; see System Requirements for IBM MQ .\n3. Back up your system before you install a later version of IBM MQ over an earlier version. After you\nstart a queue manager, you cannot revert to the previous version. If you must restore the system, you\ncannot recover any work, such as changes to messages and objects, performed by the later version of\nIBM MQ. For more information about backing up your system, see Backing up and restoring IBM MQ\nqueue manager data .\n4. Review any other installed SupportPacs for their applicability to the later version.\n5. If you are running on a server with multiple installations, you must identify the installation. Make sure\nthat the commands you enter run against the correct installation; see setmqenv .\n6. From IBM MQ 9.0, the ccsid_part2.tbl file replaces the existing ccsid.tbl file that is used in\nprevious versions of the product to supply extra CCSID information.\nAttention:\nThe ccsid_part2.tbl file takes precedence over the ccsid.tbl file and:\n• Allows you to add or modify CCSID entries\n• Specify default data conversion\n• Specify data for different command levels\nThe ccsid_part2.tbl is applicable to the following platforms only:\n•\n Linux - all versions\n434   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

The procedure for removing maintenance changed at\nIBM MQ 9.4.0. Therefore, you must use the procedure that is detailed in earlier versions of the product\ndocumentation to remove the maintenance.\nImportant: You must stop all IBM MQ queue managers, other objects, and applications, before you begin\nthe process to uninstall or modify IBM MQ.\nNote: If you are upgrading the OS RHEL version, you need to follow a different upgrade procedure. See\n“Applying OS updates with RDQM” on page 263 for upgrading RHEL within a version, or “Migrating an\nRDQM configuration from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9” on page 494 for updating versions.\nThis topic describes upgrading RDQM between versions. To apply maintenance level updates to RDQM,\nsee “Applying maintenance level updates for RDQM” on page 315 .

Processing can continue on\nother nodes while this is in progress.\nFor all configurations, if the upgrade is to a level of IBM MQ that is at a higher command level then, after\na queue manager has been started at the higher level, it cannot run on a node that has not yet been\nupgraded. You should plan the sequence of upgrades accordingly.\nImportant: The following commands are intended as an example of those that would be issued on a\nsystem with a single IBM MQ installation. On systems with multiple IBM MQ installations, or where\nthere are other packages installed whose name includes either \"drbd\" or \"linbit\", the commands must be\nupdated to ensure that only the packages associated with this IBM MQ installation are removed.\nFor details of how to uninstall IBM MQ on a system with multiple MQ installations please see “Uninstalling\nor modifying IBM MQ on Linux using rpm” on page 149 .\nRDQM HA\nComplete the following steps to uninstall and update an RDQM HA configuration:\n1.

You must set up a monitoring and management system to detect if the multi-instance queue manager\nhas failed and been automatically restarted. You can then find out what caused the restart, remedy it,\nand restart the standby. You must also modify applications, or the way applications are connected to the\nqueue manager, so that they can resume processing after a queue manager restart.\nProcedure\n1. Check the operating system that you are going to run the queue manager on, and the file system\non which the queue manager data and logs are stored on. Check that they can run a multi-instance\nqueue manager.\na) Consult Testing statement for IBM MQ multi-instance queue manager file systems .

Add an entry to the DNS to resolve the host name of the system that is to be migrated, to both an IPv4\naddress and an IPv6 address.\n4. Set the IPADDRV parameter to IPv6 (or set the LOCLADDR parameter to resolve to an IPv6 address).\nNote:\n• Not all IPv6 software can interpret an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address. If the combination of CONNAME\nand LOCLADDR results in an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address, ensure that the system hosting the target\nqueue manager is capable of handling this.\n• Using mapped addresses can require protocol translators in the IP network.\nThere are a number of different interconnection possibilities. Use the following two scenarios to help you\nunderstand how IBM MQ works in each case.\nProcedure\n•Non-cluster migration scenario 1\nThree systems exist that are IPv4-only capable. Each system hosts a queue manager (QM1, QM2, and\nQM3) and each queue manager connects to the other two. All CONNAME parameters in the cluster\nchannel definitions are set using DNS names rather than IP addresses.\nTo enable QM1 to be able to use channels running over IPv6, complete the following steps:\na) Upgrade the host system to have dual IPv4 and IPv6 stacks.\nImportant: A listener is required for each IP stack.\nb) Install the latest version of IBM MQ.\nc) Update the DNS table so that it has two entries for the system running QM1; one entry for its IPv4\naddress and one for its IPv6 address.\nThis enables a DNS name request to return both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for this host.\nd) Set the queue manager IPADDRV attribute to IPv6.\nNote: Even with these changes made to support IPv6 addressing, QM1 can still communicate with\nqueue managers (both existing and new ones) that are only IPv4 capable.\ne) Enable QM2 to use channels running over IPv6, as previously enabled for QM1.\nThe queue managers can now connect as follows:\n– Communications between QM1 and QM2 are now over IPv6.\n– Communications between QM1 and QM3 are still over IPv4.\n– Communications between QM2 and QM3 are still over IPv4.\nWith the queue manager IPADDRV attribute set to IPv6, the preference is set for the queue manager to\nconnect using the IPv6 protocol. If a channel from QM1 to QM3 has LOCLADDR set to a host name that\nresolves to an IPv6 address, or has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and the IPADDRV attribute is set to\nIPv6, then the IPv6 address is returned and the channel attempts to use the IPv6 protocol. If the IPv6\nprotocol installed on the QM1 host system can use a mapped address, then QM1 communicates with\nQM3 over IPv6. Otherwise, the channel cannot resolve the CONNAME .\nWhile QM3 remains a queue manager on an earlier version of the product, you must ensure that no\nCONNAME used to start a channel to QM3 resolves either to an IPv6 address, or to dual IPv4 and IPv6\naddresses where the IPv6 address could be returned. Otherwise QM1 attempts to start the channel\nover IPv6, which fails because it cannot resolve the CONNAME .\nYou can upgrade a system to have dual IPv4 and IPv6 capability and still run a queue manager on\nan earlier version of the product. Although it is not recommended to run this type of configuration, it\nshould work provided the addresses that are returned to this level of queue manager are either IPv4\naddresses, or IPv4 mapped versions of IPv6 addresses.\n•Non-cluster migration scenario 2\n502   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Some\ntypes of migration are required, and some are optional. Queue manager migration is never required after\napplying a maintenance level update, that does not change the command level. Some types of migration\nare automatic, and some are manual. Queue manager migration is typically automatic and required after\nreleases and manual and optional after a maintenance level upgrade that introduces a new function.\nApplication migration is typically manual and optional.\nApplying maintenance to IBM MQ\nMaintenance is the application of a reversible fix. Any changes to queue manager data are compatible\nwith the previous code level.\nBefore you begin\nThis task assumes that you understand the difference between Long Term Support and Continuous\nDelivery releases, and the maintenance delivery model that applies in each case. For more information,\nsee IBM MQ Release Types and versioning .\nAbout this task\nAbout applying maintenance\nMaintenance deliveries for a particular version/release are cumulative, from the initial release. You can\napply any higher numbered fix pack or cumulative security update (CSU) of the same version/release to\nupgrade directly to that version level. You do not have to apply the intervening fixes.\nYou can also refresh the full version of IBM MQ by installing a manufacturing refresh that is available\nonline or on physical media. The result of installing a manufacturing refresh is the same as applying a\nmaintenance delivery to an earlier fix level of IBM MQ. However, on platforms other than Windows and\nLinux, there is one important difference: Fix packs and CSUs are applied using a maintenance procedure,\nmanufacturing refreshes are installed using an installation procedure. You can \"unapply\" a fix pack or CSU\nto return to the previous fix level you had installed. You can only uninstall a manufacturing refresh, which\nremoves IBM MQ from your system.\nIn addition to manufacturing refreshes and maintenance deliveries, you might occasionally be directed by\nIBM Support to apply an interim fix. Interim fixes are also known as emergency or test fixes, and are used\nto apply urgent updates that cannot wait for the next maintenance delivery. Interim fixes are known by a\nunique fix name, which will include the target version and platform, and other identifying context, such as\na support case reference or APAR number. When you apply a new CSU, fix pack, or manufacturing refresh,\nall interim fixes are removed. The documentation with maintenance delivery or manufacturing refresh\nincludes a \"fix list\" page, stating which APAR fixes are included in the deliverable. This list tells you if the\nAPARs associated with the interim fixes that you have applied have been fixed in the latest maintenance.\nIf they have not, check to see if there are new interim fixes, at the new level, for the APARs that concern\nyou. If there are not, consult IBM Support. They might tell you to reapply the interim fix, or they might\nsupply a new interim fix.\nYou get manufacturing refreshes, maintenance deliveries and interim fixes through Passport Advantage\nand Fix Central. See “Where to find downloadable installation images” on page 12 .\n• Manufacturing refreshes are available through Passport Advantage.\n• Fix packs and CSUs are available through Fix Central.\n• Interim fixes are typically provided directly by IBM Support through a support case, and occasionally\nprovided through Fix Central.\nInstalling and migrating   293"}

To create unique packages, you run the crtmqpkg command:\ncrtmqpkg PACKAGE_SUFFIX\nWhere PACKAGE_SUFFIX is a string added to package files to make them unique.\nTo install RDQM alongside existing IBM MQ installations, you must run crtmqpkg twice, once for the main\nIBM MQ package and once for the RDQM component that has a separate rpm file under the Advanced/\nRDQM subdirectory. For both commands, you should specify the same PACKAGE_SUFFIX . When you run\ncrtmqpkg for the RDQM package, you supply RPMDIR and SPECDIR arguments to specify where the\nRDQM package files reside.\nNote:\n• By default, the crtmqpkg command writes to the /var/tmp directory. To use a different location, you\ncan set the TMPDIR environment variable before you run the crtmqpkg command.\n• Before you can run the crtmqpkg command on Linux, you must have the pax and rpmbuild\ncommands installed. These commands are not supplied as part of the product. You must get them\nfrom your Linux distribution supplier. The rpmbuild command is located in the rpm-build package.\nProcedure\nTo create unique installation packages for RDQM:\n1. Decompress the downloaded software to your installation directory, see “Installing the first IBM MQ\ninstallation on Linux using the rpm command” on page 112 .\n2. From your installation directory, create unique packages for the IBM MQ components:\n./crtmqpkg RDQM\n3. From your installation directory, create unique packages for the RDQM components:\nRPMDIR= install_directory_path /MQServer/Advanced/RDQM SPECDIR= install_directory_path /MQServer/\nAdvanced/RDQM/repackage ./crtmqpkg RDQM\nWhere install_directory_path is the full path to your installation directory.\n4. Install IBM MQ with RDQM using the packages you created in this task. Note that, as you are installing\nan additional instance of IBM MQ, you will need to use the --prefix option with rpm to specify a\nnon-default installation location.\na) Change to the directory containing the unique packages that were created, for example:\ncd /var/tmp/mq_rpms/RDQM/x86_64\n262   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Being able to stage a migration is important, as\nmigrating each queue manager in a cluster takes time. By staging the migration, which leaves other\nqueue managers that are in the cluster running, you reduce the effect of queue manager downtime on\napplications.\nMigrate queue managers with full repositories first. Then migrate the other queue managers, which have\npartial repositories, one at a time. Complete migration of the entire cluster before starting to use new\nfunctions.\nIf you do have to start using new functions before completing migration of the entire cluster, you might\nneed to refresh the partial repositories. After each migration of a queue manager with a partial repository,\nissue the REFRESH CLUSTER command on the newly migrated queue manager. The command updates\nthe cluster records in the newly migrated queue manager, potentially receiving updates for any new\nattributes. Do not do this step if you migrated the entire cluster before using new function. The REFRESH\nCLUSTER command takes a long time for all the changes to work through the cluster.\nNote: For large clusters, using the REFRESH CLUSTER command can be disruptive to the cluster while it\nis in progress, and again at 27 day intervals thereafter when the cluster objects automatically send status\nupdates to all interested queue managers. See Refreshing in a large cluster can affect performance and\navailability of the cluster .\nIf full repositories are not migrated before partial repositories, the cluster continues to work, but without\nall the new features in a version working as expected. To work predictably, the full repository queue\nmanagers must be running the latest IBM MQ major version (for LTS users) or CD version (for CD users).\nThis ensures that the full repositories can store information from the rest of the cluster that arises from\nusing new features.\nA repository stores a record it receives in its own version. If the record it receives is at a later version, the\nlater version attributes are discarded when the record is stored. An IBM MQ 9.3 queue manager receiving\ninformation about an IBM MQ 9.4 queue manager stores only IBM MQ 9.3 information. An IBM MQ 9.4\nrepository receiving an IBM MQ 9.3 record stores default values for attributes introduced in the later\nversion. The defaults define the values for the attributes that are not included in the record it receives. For\nmore information, see “How mixed version cluster repositories are updated” on page 487 .\nNote: In exceptional circumstances, it might be necessary to upgrade some of your partial repositories\nbefore your full repositories.\nWhile the product supports this configuration, in this situation be very careful to avoid use of any new\nclustering function on the partial repositories, until your full repositories have been upgraded, to avoid\nunexpected results.\n486   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

For example: /mqm/V9R4M0/mqft .\nNote that the mqft directory structure is the same as before, apart from the bin directory.\nIn earlier versions of MFT the bin directory was a peer of the mqf t directory. That is, you might have\ninstalled MFT into a /mqmfte/V9R1Mn/ directory , and that directory would have contained both an\nmqft and a bin directory.\nFrom IBM MQ for z/OS 9.2, the bin directory is located underneath the mqft directory; for\nexample: /mqm/V9R4M0/mqft/bin .\nImportant: As part of migrating IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4, you should:\n1.

Any changes to queue manager data are compatible\nwith the previous code level.\nSetting up the user and group on Linux\nOn Linux systems, IBM MQ requires a user ID of the name mqm , with a primary group of mqm . The mqm user\nID owns the directories and files that contain the resources associated with the product.\nUsing Active Directory\nIf you are using Active Directory to provide centralized user and group definitions to your Linux system, it\nis not possible to have both an mqm user and mqm group definition in Active Directory because that service\ndoes not permit users and groups to have the same name.\nYou should:\n• Put an mqm group definition in the Active Directory before installing IBM MQ, so that other users in the\ndirectory can later be made part of the shared group definition.\n• Create the mqm user locally, or allow it to be created during the installation process.\nCreating the user ID and group\nSet the primary group of the mqm user to the group mqm .\nIf you are installing IBM MQ on multiple systems you might want to ensure each UID and GID of mqm\nhas the same value on all systems. If you are planning to configure multi-instance queue managers, it is\nessential the UID and GID are the same from system to system. It is also important to have the same UID\nand GID values in virtualization scenarios.\nRPM creates the mqm user ID and group mqm , with a home directory of /var/mqm , as part of the\ninstallation procedure if they do not exist.\nIf you have special requirements for these IDs ( for example they need to have the same values as other\nmachines you are using, or your users and group ID are centrally managed) you should create the IDs\nbefore running the installation procedure, using the groupadd and useradd commands to set the UID\nand GID the same on each machine.\nNote: The only IBM MQ requirement, is that the mqm user should have the mqm group as its primary group.\nAdding existing user IDs to the group on Linux systems\nIf you want to run administration commands, for example crtmqm (create queue manager) or strmqm\n(start queue manager), your user ID must be a member of the mqm group. This user ID must not be longer\nthan 12 characters.\nUsers do not need mqm group authority to run applications that use the queue manager; it is needed only\nfor the administration commands.\nLog files created by MQ Telemetry service\nThe umask setting of the user ID that creates a queue manager will determine the permissions of the\nTelemetry log files generated for that queue manager. Even though the ownership of the log files will be\nset to mqm .\nInstalling and migrating   99"}

These files contain user data and remain so subsequent installations can reuse the data.\nMost of the remaining files contain text, such as INI files, error logs, and FDC files. The directory\ntree /var/mqm/shared contains files that are shared across installations, including the executable\nshared libraries libmqzsd.so and libmqzsd_r.so .\nWhat to do next\n• If the product successfully uninstalled, you can delete any files and directories that are contained in the\ninstallation directory.\n• If no other IBM MQ installations exist on the system, and you are not planning to reinstall or migrate,\nyou can delete the /var/mqm and /etc/opt/mqm directory trees, including the files libmqzsd.so\nand libmqzsd_r.so . Deleting these directories destroys all queue managers and their associated\ndata.\nUninstalling or modifying IBM MQ on Linux Red Hat using dnf\nOn Linux Red Hat, you can uninstall the IBM MQ server or client using the dnf command. You can also\nmodify an installation by removing selected packages (components) currently installed on your system.\nBefore you begin\nDepending on which version of IBM MQ is installed, you might need to remove maintenance\nbefore you uninstall the base packages:\n• If you are uninstalling a version of IBM MQ at IBM MQ 9.4.0 or later, you do not need to remove\nmaintenance before you uninstall IBM MQ.\n• If you are uninstalling a version of IBM MQ before IBM MQ 9.4.0, you must remove any maintenance\nthat is applied to IBM MQ before you can uninstall. The procedure for removing maintenance changed at\nIBM MQ 9.4.0. Therefore, you must use the procedure that is detailed in earlier versions of the product\ndocumentation to remove the maintenance.\nImportant: You must stop all IBM MQ queue managers, other objects, and applications, before you begin\nthe process to uninstall or modify IBM MQ.\nProcedure\n1. Stop all IBM MQ applications associated with the installation you are uninstalling or modifying, if you\nhave not already done so.\n2. For a server installation, end any IBM MQ activity associated with the installation you are uninstalling\nor modifying:\na) Log in as a user in the group mqm .\nb) Set up your environment to work with the installation you want to uninstall or modify.

Incorporate the task to migrate a queue manager, “Migrating IBM MQ for z/OS - order of\ntasks” on page 473 , into your plan.\nMigration plan overview for your enterprise\nMigration phase Required tasks\nPhase I, before migration. Prepare each queue manager in your enterprise for\nmigration.\nSee “Preparing to migrate a single IBM MQ for\nz/OS queue manager” on page 474 for further\ninformation.\nPhase II, migrate each single queue manager in\nthe order listed.Carry out this process for each queue manager.\nFor queue managers in a cluster, migrate full\nrepository queue managers before migrating any\npartial repository queue managers.\nPhase III, post migration. See “Post migration tasks” on page 482 for further\ninformation.\nProcedure\n1. Review the IBM MQ system requirements for IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4.\nSee System requirements for IBM MQ .\n2. Review all the changes in the product that affect you.\nFor more information, see What's new and changed in IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4.0 .\n3. Review performance changes.\nSee IBM MQ - Performance documents .\n4. Plan the sequence and timing of queue manager migrations.\n• Check that any products using the queue managers support IBM MQ for z/OS 9.4.\n• If the queue manager is a member of a queue manager cluster, you must consider the order of\nmigration of queue managers in the cluster; see “Migrating a queue manager cluster” on page 485 .\n• Queue managers in a QSG, and queue managers in a cluster can be migrated in parallel, but at any\ntime there should be enough queue managers working in the QSG, and cluster, to ensure that your\nbusiness can operate satisfactorily while a staged migration takes place. See “Queue sharing group\nmigration” on page 472 .\n5. Plan to update any manual or automated procedures you have written with changes to messages and\ncodes.\n6. Plan to update applications that might be affected by changes.\nConsider whether the application must be able to run on both the previous version and IBM MQ for\nz/OS 9.4.

Plan the sequence and timing of queue manager migrations.\n• If the queue manager is part of a queue manager cluster, you must migrate the queue managers\nthat are full repositories first.\n• If the queue manager is part of a high availability cluster, plan the migration to minimize downtime\nand maximize availability; see “Migrating a queue manager in a high-availability configuration” on\npage 491 .\n7. Plan to migrate your queue manager to the later version.\nSee “Migrating a queue manager to a later version on Windows” on page 397 .\nBacking up queue manager data is part of the queue manager migration task. An alternative approach\nis to install and configure a new server, then test the later version with a new queue manager on the\nnew server. When you are ready to go into production on the later version, copy the queue manager\nconfiguration and data to the new server.\n8. Plan to update any manual or automated procedures you have written with changes to messages and\ncodes.\nA suffix letter, indicating the severity of a message (I, W, E, S or T) is appended to IBM MQ diagnostic\n(AMQ) messages. Existing scripts looking for error codes without the severity will fail. For example,\nexisting scripts looking for error matching to AMQ7468 will fail. You must update the scripts to look\nfor error codes with the severity suffix added (for example, AMQ7468I). For more information, see\nIBM MQ messages on Multiplatforms .\n9. Decide on what regression tests to perform before putting the queue manager into production on\nthe later version. Include in your regression tests the procedures and applications you identified in\nprevious steps.\n10. Plan to migrate your IBM MQ MQI client installations to the later version.\n11. Plan to migrate your client and server applications to use new functions in the later version.\n12. Decide which downloadable images you require for the migration.\nFor more information, see “Where to find downloadable installation images” on page 12 .\nMigration considerations for IBM MQ 8.0 or later on Windows\nFrom IBM MQ 8.0, a number of changes were made for IBM MQ for Windows. You must understand these\nchanges before planning any migration tasks for IBM MQ 8.0 or later on Windows.\nInstalling a single copy of the product\nIf you have an existing previous version of the product on your system, and want to upgrade to the latest\nversion, you have various options. You can either:\n• Uninstall the previous version and then install the latest version,\n• Install the new copy alongside the currently installed one and uninstall the original at a later time. See\n“Installing the product alongside an existing version” on page 393 , or\n• Perform a migration installation, electing to replace the currently installed version when prompted.\nAfter you have installed the product, start each queue manager and its data migration takes place. This\nincludes the migration of queue managers from 32-bit to 64-bit.\nInstalling the product alongside an existing version\nIf you want to install another version of the product alongside your existing product you can do so. See\n“Multiple IBM MQ installations” on page 370 and “Migrating on Windows: side-by-side” on page 405 for\nfurther information.\nWhen you install the new version of the product, run the setmqm command to associate the queue\nmanagers with the new installation.\nStart each queue manager in turn and its data migration takes place.\nInstalling and migrating   393"}

Those fixes, whether they are applied by using a\nmaintenance installation tool, or installed by using a manufacturing refresh on top of an installation,\nare at the same command level as the existing code. No migration is required after applying\nmaintenance.

IPv4 has been in use for over 20 years and is one of the primary\nmethods for machines to communicate with each other over the internet. IPv4 is limited to 32-bit\naddressing for internet addresses. These addresses are needed by all new machines added to the internet\nand they are beginning to run out. The IETF is the controlling standards body for the Internet and to meet\nthe growing demand for internet addresses the IETF has increased the number of digits used for Internet\naddresses from 32 to 128 bits. IPv6 offers a far larger number (2 128 ) of internet addresses and should\nsolve the address shortage for the foreseeable future. IPv6 is expected to gradually replace IPv4, with\nthe two protocols coexisting for a number of years. IPv6 also simplifies header formats and improves\nsupport for extensions and options, flow labeling capability, and consolidated authentication and privacy\ncapabilities.\nIPv6 is supported on the following IBM MQ platforms:\n•\n AIX\n•\n IBM i\n•\n Linux\n•\n Windows\n•\n z/OS\nFor more information about IPv6, see IPv6 .\nMigrating a queue manager to IPv6\nTwo example scenarios for migrating a non-cluster queue manager topology to an IPv6 network.\nBefore you begin\nTo use the IPv6 protocol, IBM MQ must be installed on a system that is IPv6 capable.\nAbout this task\nIf both IPv4 and IPv6 are available, the preferred IP version that two systems use for communicating is\ndetermined by the queue manager attribute IPADDRV . This parameter only has an effect if the host name\nresolves ambiguously to both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.\nThese are the broad steps to migrate a queue manager to use the IPv6 protocol.

To view the telemetry folder, you must start a queue manager.\nBefore running the define sample configuration wizard on an existing queue manager, review the\ninformation provided by the wizard about the configuration changes that are made. The changes might\nhave implications for the configuration of the existing queue manager. Alternatively, run the sample\nconfiguration wizard on a newly created queue manager to avoid changing any security settings.\nAbout this task\nTo configure MQ Telemetry there is a define sample configuration wizard that can be run from IBM MQ\nExplorer. The wizard runs through a series of steps, including defining and starting the telemetry (MQXR)\nservice, setting up the default transmission queue, and configuring a telemetry channel.\nIf you would prefer to do this manually, see Configuring a queue manager for telemetry on Linux and AIX .\nFor Windows, see Configuring a queue manager for telemetry on Windows .\nYou can open the define sample configuration wizard from the MQ Telemetry Welcome page in IBM MQ\nExplorer. The wizard determines which steps are required based on the current configuration.\nFor example, the following actions might be specified by the wizard:\n•Define the telemetry (MQXR) service.\n• Start the telemetry (MQXR) service.\n•Define the telemetry transmit queue.\nInstalling and migrating   249"}

However new features cannot be exploited from queue managers at an earlier level.\nRouting behavior in a mixed version publish/subscribe cluster\nFrom IBM MQ 8.0, topic host routing is available for publish/subscribe clusters. The queue manager\nwhere the object is defined, and the full repository queue managers, must be at a level that supports the\ntopic route hosting feature, that is IBM MQ 8.0 or later. Any queue manager in the cluster that is at an\nearlier level does not adhere to the topic route hosting behavior.\nWhen a clustered topic is defined for topic host routing (by setting the topic CLROUTE parameter to\nTOPICHOST ), only queue managers at the new level are aware of the clustered topic. Older queue\nmanagers do not receive the clustered topic definition and therefore behave as if the topic is not\nclustered. This means that all queue managers that need to work in a routed publish/subscribe manner\nmust be at a version that supports this feature, not just the queue managers that host the routed topics.\nImportant notes:\n• All full repositories must be at IBM MQ 8.0 or later to use this feature. If a full repository queue manager\nis at an earlier version, the CLROUTE of TOPICHOST is not recognized by the full repository, and the\nfull repository propagates the topic definition to all queue managers in the cluster. Any pre-IBM MQ 8.0\nqueue managers then use the topic as if it is defined for DIRECT routing. This behavior is unsupported.\n• If an older queue manager defines a direct routed clustered topic with the same name as an existing\ntopic host routed clustered topic, the full repositories notice the conflicting definition and do not\npropagate the definition.\nTo find out the version of each queue manager in the cluster, specify the VERSION parameter with the\nDISPLAY CLUSQMGR command. If you issue this command from a queue manager with a full repository,\nthe information returned applies to every queue manager in the cluster. Otherwise the information\nreturned applies only to the queue managers in which it has an interest. That is, every queue manager to\nwhich it has tried to send a message and every queue manager that holds a full repository.\nISPF operations and control panels on z/OS\nWhen using the operations and control panels, the IBM MQ libraries you use in ISPF must be compatible\nwith the queue manager you are working with.\nCompatibility of queue manager versions with operations and control panel versions on z/OS shows which\nversions of the operations and controls panels you use in ISPF are compatible with which levels of queue\nmanager.\n382   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Entries in the tables are client connections, which are defined using a\nqueue manager. The version of a CCDT is the version of the queue manager used to define the client\nconnections. If an IBM MQ client uses CCDT to connect to a queue manager, the CCDT can be at a version\ngreater than, less than, or equal to that of the client.\nYou can connect to a queue manager with an earlier IBM MQ client or an earlier CCDT. If you are using\na CCDT, and you plan to use new client channel configuration options, such as shared conversations, you\nmust upgrade the CCDT, and therefore the IBM MQ client installation, to the new version.\nMQ clients: Client Channel Definition Table (CCDT)\nYou can connect a supported IBM MQ client application to any supported level of queue manager. If a\nclient uses CCDT to connect to a queue manager, the CCDT can be at a version greater than, less than, or\nequal to that of the client.\nWhen a client uses a CCDT file that was generated using a newer version of IBM MQ, only channel\nattributes within the CCDT that were available at the client's IBM MQ version are considered during\nnegotiation with the queue manager. Channel attributes present in the CCDT that were added in newer\nversions of IBM MQ will be ignored by older clients.\nVersion of originating queue manager for a CCDT\nBefore IBM MQ 9.0, clients can use a CCDT built by the same or earlier version queue manager, but there\nwas previously a restriction on clients using a CCDT built by a later version queue manager. However, this\nrestriction is removed in IBM MQ 9.0.\nFrom IBM MQ 9.0, if a client uses a CCDT, it can use a CCDT built by a later version queue manager, as well\nas a CCDT built by the same, or earlier version of queue manager.\nThe same restriction on the use of CCDTs originating from later version queue managers is also removed\nin IBM MQ 8.0, and earlier versions, by APARs IT10863 and IT11547. for more information, see the\ntechnote MQ 7.x, MQ 8.0, MQ 9.0, MQ 9.1, MQ9.2, and MQ9.3 compatibility with previous versions -\nincluding usage of CCDT files, JMS .bindings, SSL/TLS .\nCommon migration scenarios\nIf, for example, you upgrade a queue manager from an earlier release to a later release, and you do not\ncreate new CCDTs for its clients, the clients connect to the later release queue manager without any\nchanges being required. Client behavior might change as a result of changes to the queue manager.\nAnother common migration scenario is to update some queue managers and some clients to a later\nrelease, leaving other queue managers and clients at the earlier release. In this scenario, you want to\nupdate the CCDT for the IBM MQ clients to the same release as the queue managers to which they\nconnect, so that those clients can fully use the function in the later release. The new clients can also\nconnect to the earlier release queue managers. Existing clients connect to queue managers in both\nreleases. In order that the clients in the later release can use the new function in that release, you must\ndeploy a CCDT that has been generated by a queue manager in that new release. Clients in the earlier\nrelease can continue to use the CCDT for that earlier release.

Existing applications switch from loading the libraries from the earlier\nversion, to loading the libraries of the later version, automatically. Queue managers are automatically\nassociated with the installation on the later version.

For more information, see “License requirements” on page 8 and IBM MQ license\ninformation .\nAlso review the information on hardware and software requirements for the platform on which you are\nplanning to install IBM MQ. For more information, see “Where to find product requirements and support\ninformation” on page 11 .\nInstallation of IBM MQ on Multiplatforms\nIBM MQ can be installed as a server or a client. The installation images can be downloaded. See “Where\nto find downloadable installation images” on page 12 .\nSeparate client eImages are no longer available for downloading from Passport Advantage. Instead, you\ncan either get the client eImage from inside the main IBM MQ server eImage, which includes the server\nand client, or you can download the IBM MQ client components from Fix Central. Follow the links in\nResource adapter, clients and other resources .\nAn IBM MQ server is an installation of one or more queue managers that provide queuing services to one\nor more clients. All the IBM MQ objects, for example queues, exist only on the queue manager machine\n(the IBM MQ server machine), and not the client. An IBM MQ server can also support local IBM MQ\napplications.\nAn IBM MQ MQI client is a component that allows an application running on one system to communicate\nwith a queue manager running on another system. The output from the call is sent back to the client,\nwhich passes it back to the application.\n6  Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

If a\nclient uses CCDT to connect to a queue manager, the CCDT can be at a version greater than, less than, or\nequal to that of the client.\n“Supported IBM MQ client: Default behavior of client-connection and server-connection channels” on\npage 388\nApplication migration and interoperation\nIBM MQ supports running applications compiled and linked against previous versions of IBM MQ, with\nlater levels of IBM MQ. Use the new version of the libraries to build the applications, once the queue\nmanagers have been upgraded.\nTo migrate an application to run with a new level of IBM MQ, disconnect an application from the queue\nmanager. Reconnect it when the queue manager is running again. However, it takes only one small\ndifference in the interface between IBM MQ and the application to break an application, or make it behave\nwrongly. Sometimes a problem does not show up for a long time. For this reason, you must always test\nyour applications against a new version of IBM MQ. The suggested extent of testing varies depending on\nthe extent of the changes in IBM MQ; see “Upgrade and migration of IBM MQ on z/OS ” on page 469 or\n“Characteristics of different types of upgrade” on page 292 .\nApplication migration refers to four kinds of changes.\n1. Application changes that are consequent to upgrading the operating environment along with the queue\nmanager. Rarely, linkage conventions change. The most likely reason for a linkage change is switching\nfrom 32 bit to a 64 bit environment. If you are using SSL or TLS you might have to relink with a new\nsecure library.\n2. Changes that you must make to the application in order to run an application against a new level of\nqueue manager. Changes of this sort are uncommon. However, you must check “Changes that affect\nmigration” on page 354 to see if any changes might affect your applications.\n3. Changes that are not required, but that you might want to make in future, perhaps because you have a\nbusiness reason to modify an application.\n4. Changes to applications that are supplied by IBM, or other vendors, that require you to run migration\nutilities. The utilities convert the applications to running on the new version of IBM MQ.\nDo not load IBM MQ libraries from an earlier level. IBM MQ does not support connecting server\napplications loading libraries from the earlier level to connect to a later level of queue manager. On\nAIX, Linux, and Windows platforms, the application load path must be set up to the location of the IBM\nMQ server libraries. You do not have to recompile and relink an application. Applications compiled and\nlinked against an earlier version of IBM MQ can load libraries from a later version.\nOn Multiplatforms , the product loads the library from the installation the application is\nconnecting to. An application must initially load a library of at least the same level as the application\nlinked to. IBM MQ then loads the correct version of the library from the installation that the queue\nmanager is associated with. If you have two installations of the same version, but at different fix levels,\nIBM MQ chooses which library to load. The choice is based on the queue manager the application is\nconnected to. If an application is connected to multiple queue managers, it is possible that multiple\nlibraries are loaded.\nTo help you write applications that can exchange messages with earlier versions of the product, IBM\nMQ provides data type versioning. Data type versioning assists you in exchanging messages that are\ncompatible with target queue managers. A good programming practice is to set the version number of\na data structure explicitly. Do not assume that the default version is the one you require. By setting the\nversion explicitly, you are forced to look up what version to use. The description of the data type version\ntells you what level of queue manager supports that version.\nIt is poor practice to set the data type version to the current version. If you recompile your program\nagainst a new version of IBM MQ, the data type version might change with unexpected consequences.\nClient applications are more likely to connect to different queue managers than applications written\nfor a specific server. Plan carefully when writing an application that is to connect to different versions\nof a queue manager, and to queue managers on different platforms.

Side-by-side migration: migrated queue managers connected to and applications associated with\nlater version\nThe advantage that the side-by-side migration has over the single-stage migration is that you can install\nand verify the later IBM MQ installation on the server before you switch over to it.\nAlthough side-by-side migration is less flexible than multi-stage migration, it does have some advantages\nover the multi-stage approach. With the side-by-side approach, you can assign a later version of IBM\nMQ to be the primary installation. With the multistage approach, and one version of IBM MQ set as the\nprimary installation, many applications restart without having to reconfigure their environment, as IBM\nMQ commands work without providing a local search path.\nFor more information about side-by-side migration, see:\n•\n “Migrating on AIX and Linux: side-by-side” on page 430\n•\n “Migrating on Windows: side-by-side” on page 405\nNote: \n Side-by-side migration has a different meaning on IBM i.

Multi-stage migration is the most flexible approach.\nAfter you install the later version alongside the earlier version, you can create new queue managers\nto verify the installation of the later version, and develop new applications. At the same time, you can\nmigrate queue managers and their associated applications from the earlier version to the later version. By\nmigrating queue managers and applications one by one, you can reduce the peak workload on your staff\nwho are managing the migration.\nInstalling and migrating   369"}

Some\ntypes of migration are required, and some are optional. Queue manager migration is never required after\napplying a maintenance level update, that does not change the command level. Some types of migration\nare automatic, and some are manual. Queue manager migration is typically automatic and required after\nreleases and manual and optional after a maintenance level upgrade that introduces a new function.\nApplication migration is typically manual and optional.\nBefore you begin\nBefore upgrading your IBM MQ installation or migrating your queue managers, you must read “Changes\nthat affect migration” on page 354 to identify what migration tasks you must plan for.\nAbout this task\nWhenever you upgrade IBM MQ to a new release that changes its command level, migration is performed\nby the queue manager. Whenever you upgrade IBM MQ to a new maintenance or fix level, which\nintroduces a new function using a new command level, you can migrate the queue manager to use the\nnew command level and thereby the new function.\nIf you start a queue manager running on a later release level, then migration of the queue manager to that\nrelease level is required. .\nOn IBM MQ for Multiplatforms , you cannot easily revert to a previous level of IBM MQ after\ninstallation. If you install a copy of IBM MQ obtained from Passport Advantage or from physical media,\nthe installer uninstalls IBM MQ, if it is present. It then installs the new level of IBM MQ. To revert to the\nprevious level of IBM MQ, you must keep the earlier installation image and any fixes you applied. Then\nyou must uninstall the new level, reinstall the previous release level, and reapply the required fixes. If\nyou have started any queue managers at the later level, they will not work with the restored level of\nIBM MQ. (Unless you installed a later maintenance level upgrade, not a new release or version: then\nyou could revert to an earlier maintenance level by reinstalling the earlier maintenance level upgrade.\nQueue manager data is compatible between maintenance levels.) To restore IBM MQ to its previous level,\nafter starting any queue managers, you must first back up the queue managers. You can then restore the\nbackup queue managers after restoring the previous level of IBM MQ.\nOn IBM MQ for z/OS you can backwards migrate from a Long Term Support\n(LTS) release. This also applies to CD releases that have the same VRM as an LTS release, for example IBM\nMQ 9.3.0 CD.\nBackwards migration is not supported to or from a Continuous Delivery (CD) release on\nz/OS, unless those releases have the same VRM as an LTS release, for example IBM MQ 9.3.0 CD.\nImportant: \n From IBM MQ 9.4.0, AMQP channels no longer support CMS key\nrepository files. Instead, you need to use PKCS #12 key repositories and protect the key repository\npasswords by using the IBM MQ password protection system. You set the password in the queue\nmanager's KEYRPWD attribute.\nInstalling and migrating   353"}

Use this information to create and set up a special domain\naccount for the IBM MQ service. Do this if IBM MQ is to be installed on a Windows domain where local\naccounts do not have the authority to query the group membership of the domain user accounts.\nAbout this task\nAfter you add a local user to the mqm group, that user can administer IBM MQ on the system. This task\ndescribes how to do the same using Windows domain user IDs.\nThere is an IBM MQ component for checking Windows privileges. This component runs as a Windows\nservice under a local user account created by IBM MQ at installation. This component checks that the\naccount under which the IBM MQ services are run has the following privileges:\n• The account has the ability to query group memberships of domain accounts.\n• The account has the authority to administer IBM MQ.\nIf the account does not have the ability to query group memberships, the access checks made by the\nservices fail.\nWindows domain controllers running Windows Active Directory can be set up so that local accounts do\nnot have the authority to query the group membership of the domain user accounts. This prevents IBM\nMQ from completing its checks, and access fails. If you are using Windows on a domain controller that\nhas been set up in this way, you must instead use a special domain user account with the required\npermissions.\nEach installation of IBM MQ on the network must be configured to run its service under a domain\nuser account that has the required authority to check that users who are defined on the domains\nare authorized to access queue managers or queues. Typically, this special account has the IBM MQ\nadministrator rights through membership of the domain group DOMAIN\\Domain mqm . The domain group\nis automatically nested by the installation program under the local mqm group of the system on which IBM\nMQ is being installed.\nImportant:\n1. By default, Windows 10 version 1607 or later, and Windows Server 2016 or later, are more restrictive\nthan earlier versions of Windows. These later versions restrict clients allowed to make remote calls\nto the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), and could prevent IBM MQ queue managers from starting.\nAccess to SAM is critical for the functioning of IBM MQ when IBM MQ is configured as a domain\naccount.\n2. The IBM MQ installer must be given the user ID and password details of the special domain user\naccount. The installer can then use this information to configure the IBM MQ service after the product\nis installed. If an installer continues and configures IBM MQ without a special account, many or all\nparts of IBM MQ will not work, depending upon the particular user accounts involved, as follows:\n• IBM MQ connections to queue managers running under Windows domain accounts on other\ncomputers might fail.\n• Typical errors include AMQ8066: Local mqm group not found and AMQ8079: Access was\ndenied when attempting to retrieve group membership information for user\n'abc@xyz' .\nYou must repeat steps “1” on page 197 and “8” on page 197 of the following procedure for each domain\nthat has user names that will administer IBM MQ. This creates an account for IBM MQ on each domain.\n196   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

If you use a floating IP address to connect to\nan RDQM queue manager then you must recreate that floating IP address on the new cluster.\nThe upgrade sequence for HA RDQM configurations consists of suspending a node, uninstalling IBM MQ\nand RDQM support, installing the newer version of IBM MQ and RDQM support, then resuming the node.\nYou then move on and repeat this sequence on the next node. Following this sequence ensures that your\nqueue managers continue to run on one of the nodes in the HA group while the migration is in progress.\nThe upgrade sequence for DR RDQM configurations consists of upgrading the recovery node, running the\nDR queue managers on the newly upgraded recovery node, upgrading the primary node, switching the DR\nqueue managers back to running on the primary node.\nThe upgrade sequence for DR/HA RDQM configurations consists of upgrading the HA group on the\nrecovery site, performing a managed failover from the main site to the recovery site, and then upgrading\nthe HA group on the main site before failing the queue managers back to the main site.\nYou can back up a replicated data queue manager before migration.\nRelated tasks\n“Installing RDQM (replicated data queue managers)” on page 253\nInstallation tasks associated with RDQM are grouped in this section.

For prerequisites and guidance how to create a multi-instance queue\nmanager, see Multi-instance queue managers .\nIf you are running multi-instance queue managers, you then can apply a maintenance update to a running\nqueue manager by switching the active instance to a different server.\nTypically, active and standby installations are maintained at the same maintenance level. Consult the\nmaintenance instructions for each update. Consult the instructions to see if it is possible to run the active\nand standby instances at different maintenance levels. Check whether fail over from higher to lower, or\nonly lower to higher maintenance level is possible.\nThe instructions for applying a maintenance update might require you to stop a multi-instance queue\nmanager completely.\nIf you have a primary server for running active queue manager instances, and a secondary server that\nruns standby instances, you have a choice of updating the primary or secondary server first. If you update\nthe secondary server first, you must switch back to the primary server when both servers have been\nupdated.\nIf you have active and standby instances on several servers, you must plan in what order you update the\nservers to minimize the disruption caused by ending the active instances on each server you update.\nAbout this task\nCombine the steps in this task with the maintenance update procedure for applying maintenance to an\nIBM MQ server installation.\nProcedure\n1. Ensure that no queue manager instances are running on the server that you intend to apply\nmaintenance to:\n• If the queue manager is running as standby, end the standby with the following command:\nendmqm -x QMgrName\n• If the queue manager is running as the active instance, end the instance and transfer control to the\nstandby instance with the endmqm command. For example:\nendmqm -shutdown_option -s QMgrName\nwhere -shutdown_option is an optional parameter specifying the type of shutdown. For more\ninformation, see endmqm .\nIf there is no standby instance running, the command fails, and you must start a standby instance\non a different server.\n• If a queue manager is running as a single instance queue manager, you have no alternative but to\nstop the queue manager before applying the maintenance update.\nWhen you complete this step, no queue manager instances are left running on the server you intend to\nupdate.\n2.

For each installation\nmedia (for example, each client and server), Instance ID 1 is the default ID which is used for single\ninstallations. If you want to install alongside Instance ID 1 you need to specify which instance you want\nto use. If you have already installed instance 1, 2, and 3 then you need to find out what the next available\ninstance is, for instance, Instance ID 4. Similarly, if instance 2 has been removed, you need to find out\nthat there is a gap that can be reused. You can find out which Instance ID is currently in use by using the\ndspmqinst command.\nProcedure\n1. Type dspmqinst to find a free MSI Instance in the media being installed by reviewing the MSIMedia\nand MSIInstanceId values for the versions already installed.

Identify the\nroles that different queue managers play in the cluster, and decide in what order to migrate the queue\nmanagers.\nProcedure\n• What queue manager and application migration issues must be dealt with between the old and new\nversions?\n• What system architecture and change control procedures must you consider?\n• Consider migration questions specific to clusters, such as migrating full repositories first, and\nmigrating overlapping clusters.\n• Are any of the queue managers in a queue sharing group, or part of a high-availability solution?\n• Is the cluster a publish/subscribe cluster? Which queue manager is a cluster topic host?\n• Decide whether to carry out a staged migration, or migrate all queue managers at the same time.\n• Do you have a test system to migrate , and a production system?\n• Document and test the plan before migrating production queue managers.\nRelated concepts\n“Application migration and interoperation” on page 364\nIBM MQ supports running applications compiled and linked against previous versions of IBM MQ, with\nlater levels of IBM MQ.

For prerequisites and guidance how to create a multi-instance queue\nmanager, see Multi-instance queue managers .\nIf you are running multi-instance queue managers, you then can apply a maintenance update to a running\nqueue manager by switching the active instance to a different server.\nTypically, active and standby installations are maintained at the same maintenance level. Consult the\nmaintenance instructions for each update. Consult the instructions to see if it is possible to run the active\nand standby instances at different maintenance levels. Check whether fail over from higher to lower, or\nonly lower to higher maintenance level is possible.\nThe instructions for applying a maintenance update might require you to stop a multi-instance queue\nmanager completely.\nIf you have a primary server for running active queue manager instances, and a secondary server that\nruns standby instances, you have a choice of updating the primary or secondary server first. If you update\nthe secondary server first, you must switch back to the primary server when both servers have been\nupdated.\nIf you have active and standby instances on several servers, you must plan in what order you update the\nservers to minimize the disruption caused by ending the active instances on each server you update.\nAbout this task\nFollow these steps to apply maintenance to a multi-instance queue manager on Windows.\nProcedure\n1.

It does not matter what version of IBM MQ an\napplication is built on and connected to. It can exchange messages with an application connected to an\nearlier version of IBM MQ, as long as it does not use new function.\nConsider these four cases; the first two cases are not supported though they might work in practice, the\nlast two cases are supported.

If you are running an\nincompatible configuration and you encounter a problem, you must rebuild your applications with the\ncorrect level of IBM MQ. You can then continue with problem diagnosis.\nMulti-installation and application loading\nThe loading capability of IBM MQ libraries does not relax the restriction that an application compiled\nand linked at a later release level must not directly load an IBM MQ library at an earlier release level. In\npractice, as long as the operating system loads a library at the same or later level than the library the\napplication was compiled and linked with, IBM MQ can call any other level of IBM MQ on the same server.\nFor example, suppose you recompile and link an application that is to connect to an IBM MQ 9.1 queue\nmanager using the libraries shipped with IBM MQ 9.4. At run time the operating system must load the\nIBM MQ 9.4 libraries for the application, even though the application connects to an IBM MQ 9.1 queue\nmanager. IBM MQ 9.4 detects the inconsistency and loads the IBM MQ 9.1 library for the application. The\nsame applies to any future release. If the application is recompiled and linked against a later release, then\nthe application must load an IBM MQ library that matches the later release, even if it continues to connect\nto an IBM MQ 9.4 queue manager.\n384   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Persistent queue manager data includes log files and data in the queue manager directory.\nThe data records changes to objects such as messages, subscriptions, publications, queue managers,\nchannels, queues, and topics.\nQueue manager migration is required and largely automatic.\nYou can reduce the downtime and risk caused by queue manager migration, by verifying the new version\nfirst, using a different queue manager.

Channels continue to work normally, but channel names are not displayed\nby the runmqsc command or IBM MQ Explorer. From IBM MQ 9.2.0 Fix Pack 2, channel definitions are\nmigrated correctly when the queue manager is started for the first time at the new code level.\nWhen migrating queue managers that are members of a cluster, migrate full repositories before partial\nrepositories.

Before backing up, you must stop the queue manager.\nFor IBM MQ for z/OS, an IBM MQ 9.4.0 LTS or 9.4.0 CD queue manager can always be\nbackwards migrated to the release it was previously running at, if the release was one of IBM MQ 9.2.0\nLTS, IBM MQ 9.3.0 LTS, or IBM MQ 9.3.0 CD.\nRelated concepts\nIBM MQ release types and versioning\n“Upgrade and migration of IBM MQ on z/OS ” on page 469\nYou can install new releases of IBM MQ to upgrade IBM MQ to a new release, version or modification\n(VRM) level.

Switch to\nthe migrated group when it contains half the number of queue managers. Before you have reached the\nhalf way point, the unmigrated group are possible owners. When you reach the half way point, switch the\npossible owners to the migrated group.\nRelated concepts\nWindows: MSCS restriction with multiple installations\nRelated tasks\n“Migrating a queue manager in a high-availability configuration” on page 491\nHigh-availability configurations of queue managers can increase the availability of IBM MQ applications. If\na queue manager, or server fails, it is restarted automatically on another server. You can arrange for IBM\nMQ MQI client applications to automatically reconnect to the queue manager. Server applications can be\nconfigured to start when the queue manager starts.\nMigrating logs to an Advanced Format disk on Windows\nAn Advanced Format disk is one that has 4096 bytes per sector. The following is applicable only to the\nWindows platform as Advanced Format disks can be used on other platforms without carrying out a\nmigration procedure.\nAttention: On Windows, prior to IBM MQ 9.1.0, (or prior to IBM MQ 9.0.4 if you are a Continuous\nDelivery user), IBM MQ does not support Advanced Format disks\nNote the following:\n• A migrated log can be used on any disk whether or not it is Advanced Format.\n• If you are not using an Advanced Format disk, you do not need to migrate the log of your queue\nmanager.\n• Queue managers that are created at IBM MQ 9.1.0 (or at IBM MQ 9.0.4 or later if you are a Continuous\nDelivery user) can be used on an Advanced Format disk without being migrated.\n• If you use a queue manager that was created before IBM MQ 9.1.0 (or before IBM MQ 9.0.4 if you are a\nContinuous Delivery user) on a native Advanced Format disk, without migrating the queue manager first,\nthe queue manager will not start\n• It is possible to start a queue manager on an Advanced Format disk in emulation mode without\nmigration. However IBM MQ log writes will not be on 4k boundaries and so the queue manager will not\nhave data integrity. Once the logs have been migrated, an Advanced Format disk in emulation mode is\nreliable.\n• If you are not sure whether your disk is Advanced Format or not, use the Windows utility fsutil to find\nout.\n• The Advanced Format disks that require you to migrate your log, include 4k native disks and 512-byte\nEmulation disks.\n422   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

That is, change the value of the CipherSpec for the channel definition at each\nend, and then restart the channels for the change to take effect.\nThe procedure described in the preceding text can be particularly challenging in clustering environments.\nTypically, you need to update manually defined channel definitions to a full repository one at a time.\nTo simplify migration, you make the change to specify an alias CipherSpec on a channel definition pairing\non the responding message channel agent (that is SVRCONN, RCVR, and so on) first. For example, if the\nchannel definition currently uses a specific TLS 1.2 CipherSpec, then modifying the responding message\nchannel agent to use ANY_TLS12_OR_HIGHER allows the sending message channel agent to continue\nusing the specific TLS 1.2 cipher.\nIf you plan to change an existing cluster to use alias CipherSpecs, you first need to ensure that all\nmembers of the cluster are at IBM MQ 9.1.4, or higher, and if there are z/OS queue managers in the\ncluster, these need to be at IBM MQ 9.2.0 or later, in order to understand the new CipherSpec value. The\nprocedure for migration is the same as migrating from plaintext to SSL or TLS. See Upgrading clustered\nqueue managers and channels to SSL/TLS for more information.\nOnce both initiating and responding channel definitions use an alias CipherSpec, the negotiation of the\nTLS cipher varies, based on the availability of different algorithms on platform and maintenance levels.\nNote, that although no assurance can be made on the exact CipherSpec that is chosen, the channel\nwill only use the TLS protocol allowed by the alias CipherSpec considering FIPS, SUITEB, and weak\nCipherSpec deprecations and re-enablement on both peers.\nAttention: Alias CipherSpecs do not guarantee that a specific CipherSpec will be used on a running\nchannel, only that the negotiated CipherSpec is enabled and acceptable to IBM MQ on both ends\nof the channel. To request that a specific CipherSpec is used by a channel, you must specify that\nspecific value on both ends of the channel.\nIf you add support for a new CipherSpec to the IBM MQ installations on the initiating and responding\nends of the channel, the alias CipherSpec will allow this new CipherSpec to be used automatically without\nmaking any configuration changes.\n510   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

CSUs are produced for LTS releases (including releases in\nextended support), and also for the latest IBM MQ Continuous Delivery (CD) release, as required to\ndeliver relevant security patches.\nFor maintenance releases in or after 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF represents either a fix pack\nnumber or a CSU number. Both types of maintenance are mutually cumulative (that is, they contain\neverything included in older CSUs and fix packs), and both are installed using the same mechanisms for\napplying maintenance. Both types of maintenance update the F-digit of the VRMF to a higher number than\nany previous maintenance: fix packs use \"F\" values divisible by 5, CSUs use \"F\" values not divisible by 5.\nFor maintenance releases before 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF always represents the fix pack\nlevel. For example, the first fix pack of the IBM MQ 9.3.0 LTS release is numbered 9.3.0.1.\nFor more information, see Changes to IBM MQ's maintenance delivery model .\nProcedure\n• To upgrade a server installation by using the launchpad, follow the steps in “Upgrading an IBM MQ\nserver installation using the Launchpad” on page 349 .\n• To upgrade a server installation by using msiexec, follow the steps in “Upgrading an IBM MQ server\ninstallation using msiexec” on page 350 .\n• To upgrade a client installation by using the GUI installer, follow the steps in “Upgrading an IBM MQ\nclient installation using the GUI installer” on page 351 .\n• To upgrade a client installation by using msiexec, follow the steps in “Upgrading an IBM MQ client\ninstallation using msiexec” on page 352 .\nInstalling and migrating   327"}

IBM MQ checks the library is from the installation that is associated with the\nqueue manager. If it is not, IBM MQ loads the correct library.\nSpecial migration considerations involving loading IBM MQ libraries\nYou might have modified the installation of an early IBM MQ release to satisfy the requirements of a\nbuild environment, or the IT standards in your organization. If you copied IBM MQ libraries to other\ndirectories, or created symbolic links, you ended up with an unsupported configuration. A common IT\nstandard or build environment requirement is to include IBM MQ libraries in the default load path on AIX\nand Linux systems. You can install IBM MQ into a directory of your own choosing, and IBM MQ can create\nsymbolic links in /usr and its subdirectories. If you make an IBM MQ installation primary by using the\nsetmqinst command, IBM MQ inserts symbolic links to the IBM MQ libraries into /usr/lib . As a result,\nthe operating system finds the IBM MQ libraries in the default load path, if that includes /usr/lib .\nFor more information, see Connecting applications in a multiple installation environment .\nCommand association\nExamples of commands are dspmqver , setmqinst , runmqsc , and strmqm . The operating system\nmust find a command in an IBM MQ installation. Many commands also require a queue manager as\nan argument, and assume the default queue manager if a queue manager name is not provided as a\nparameter.\nUnlike loading libraries, if a command includes a queue manager as a parameter, the command is not\nswitched to the installation that is associated with the queue manager. You must use the setmqenv\ncommand to set up your environment correctly, so that any commands that you issue are run from\nthe correct installation. You can provide a queue manager as a parameter to setmqenv , to set up the\ncommand environment for that queue manager. For more information, see Running setmqenv .\nOn Windows, the setmqinst command sets global environment variables, and setmqenv local\nenvironment variables, including the PATH variable to find commands.\nOn AIX and Linux, the setmqinst command copies symbolic links for a subset of the commands\ninto /usr/bin . For more information, see “External library and control command links to primary\ninstallation on AIX and Linux” on page 25 . The setmqenv command sets up local environment variables,\nincluding the search path to the binary folder in the installation directory.\nThe following code shows two examples of running setmqenv to set up the command environment for\nthe copy of IBM MQ that is associated with queue manager QM1 .\nIBM MQ for Windows.\n\"%MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH %\\bin\\setmqenv\" -m QM1\nIBM MQ for AIX or Linux.\n. $MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH /bin/setmqenv -m QM1\nFigure 12.

This means that you can restart the queue manager at the specified BACKMIG version, even if an\nIPL occurs before queue manager restart, or if the queue manager is started on a different LPAR.\nIf a queue manager issues the CSQY040I message at start up, backwards migration is not supported,\nand the procedure described in the following text is not applicable. If you have a back up of the queue\nmanager data, prior to the migration, you could use that data to start the queue manager up at the earlier\nrelease.\nProcedure\n1.

The major changes made are as follows:\n1. Existing \"full product\" Managed File Transfer for z/OS (MFT) FMID HMF9110 replaced with subordinate\n\"part of product\" MFT FMID: JMS9xx7 where xx depends on exactly what is installed. For example\nJMS9207 (IBM MQ 9.2.0 LTS) or JMS9CD7 (IBM MQ 9.2.0 CD)\nNote: In this context JMS has no connection with Jakarta Messaging 3.0 or Java Message Service 2.0.\n2. MFT moved from current component ID of 5655MF900 to base product component ID of 5655MQ900 .\n3. Installation customization job CSQ8ASYJ updated to allow optional install of MFT component and\ncustomization of related JCL.\nAttention: By default, this customization is not performed, to prevent accidental installation by\nusers who are not entitled to MFT.\n4. Two additional JCL scripts have been included:\n• CSQ8I7AL for allocation of necessary libraries for MFT, and\n• CSQ8M7DD for allocation of DDEFs for MFT.\n5. MFT has always required an installation of the z/OS UNIX System Services Component FMID. By\ndefault, this installed into /usr/lpp/mqm/V9R2M0 (or similar for different versions), where:\n• R is the number of the release\n• M is the number of the modification\nMFT used to be installed into a separate directory structure, and by default, this was /usr/lpp/\nmqmfte/V9R1Mn/ . Under that directory there were three separate directories:\n•mqft : the bulk of the MFT install\n•bin : the various fte* scripts for launching MFT processes\n•java : two jar files containing prerequisites for MFT (com.ibm.mq.allclient.jar (JMS 2.0) or\ncom.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar (Jakarta Messaging 3.0), and jta.jar)\nFrom IBM MQ for z/OS 9.2, MFT installs directly into the /usr/lpp/mqm/V9R2Mn directory that first\ngets installed by the z/OS UNIX System Services (z/OS UNIX) component FMID.\nIn addition to the contents of the existing mqft directory being installed, the bin directory is now\ninstalled underneath the mqft directory. TheMFT java directory is no longer installed.\nNote: The merging of the directory structures means that there is now a tight version link between\nthe version of MFT and the version of IBM MQ. That is, if you install Managed File Transfer for z/OS, it\nneeds to be in an IBM MQ for z/OS 9.2 installation.\n6.

Repository queue managers forward object records,\nbefore they are stored, in the format that they are received in. The recipient ignores fields from a newer\nversion, and uses default values for fields that are not present in the record.\nCluster repositories hold records that represent objects, for example, a queue record represents a cluster\nqueue. A full repository holds records for all objects in the cluster. Partial repositories hold records for\nlocal objects and remote objects that are used locally. A repository record can hold information only about\nattributes at the same command level as the queue manager holding that repository. So for example, an\nIBM MQ 9.3 repository contains only IBM MQ 9.3 level attribute information. An IBM MQ 9.4 repository\ncontains all IBM MQ 9.3 records, plus IBM MQ 9.4 records containing additional IBM MQ 9.4 attributes.\nA repository stores a record it receives in its own version. If the record it receives is at a later version, the\nlater version attributes are discarded when the record is stored. An IBM MQ 9.3 queue manager receiving\ninformation about an IBM MQ 9.4 queue manager stores only IBM MQ 9.3 information. An IBM MQ 9.4\nrepository receiving an IBM MQ 9.3 record stores default values for attributes introduced in the later\nversion. The defaults define the values for the attributes that are not included in the record it receives.\nA repository normally sends records in its own version format, which is the same as the format it has\nstored them in. There is one exception to this rule. When a full repository receives a record from a partial\nrepository, it is immediately forwarded in the same format. So if an IBM MQ 9.3 full repository were to\nreceive a record from an IBM MQ 9.4 partial repository, it would forward the IBM MQ 9.4 record. It sends\nthe record to any other full repositories, and any other partial repositories that have subscriptions that\nmatch the record.\nA partial repository reflects whichever full repository sent it the latest update to a record. As a\nconsequence, you might see the information held by an IBM MQ 9.4 partial repository for new IBM MQ\n9.4 attributes changing unexpectedly. The values might change from actual IBM MQ 9.4 information to\ndefault values. The changes occur if the full repositories in the cluster are at different levels. Migrate full\nrepositories first to avoid instability.\nA partial repository sends information about its objects to a full repository periodically at least once every\n27 days. Information is sent about any object when it is altered or defined. See How long do the queue\nmanager repositories retain information?\nAfter migrating all full repositories to IBM MQ 9.4, some attributes might hold default values. The\nattributes might hold default values in place of actual values, if a repository has not received an update.\nYou can refresh the repository in either of two ways:\n• Alter the object which the record containing default values represents, for example, using ALTER QL for\na local queue. The alteration forces the local repository to send the record again.\n• Issue the REFRESH CLUSTER command on the partial repository which holds the record containing\ndefault values. REFRESH CLUSTER forces the partial repository to discard the record containing default\nvalues and get a new record as required.\nNote: For large clusters, using the REFRESH CLUSTER command can be disruptive to the cluster\nwhile it is in progress, and again at 27 day intervals thereafter when the cluster objects automatically\nsend status updates to all interested queue managers. See Refreshing in a large cluster can affect\nperformance and availability of the cluster .\nInstalling and migrating   487"}

Client migration can take place after upgrading the IBM\nMQ MQI client, and is reversible.\nIt is better to migrate the clients after the queue managers that they communicate with have been\nmigrated.\nClient migration on the client workstation is optional and manual. Client migration on the server is\nrequired and automatic. You must upgrade an IBM MQ MQI client before migrating a client workstation\nto make use of new configuration options. You can make configuration changes to client and server\nconnection channels on the server, but they have no effect on a client workstation, until the client is\nupgraded.\nAn example of client migration performed at the client workstation is to manually migrate configuration\nsettings to the mqclient.ini configuration file.\nAn example of combined client and server migration is the deployment of a new client connection\ndefinition table (CCDT). To use a new version of the CCDT, generate the table on a queue manager that is\nat the new code level. Deploy the table to clients that are going to use it. To deploy the table to a client,\nyou first must update the client to at least the same level as the queue manager that created the table.\nAn IBM MQ MQI client can interoperate with earlier and later versions of IBM MQ. Upgrading the IBM MQ\nMQI client makes new function available to client applications, and is important to maintain the service\nlevel. Migrating an IBM MQ MQI client gives it access to new configuration options.\nThe IBM MQ MQI client libraries, such as mqic.dll , are dynamic, and the application linkages to the\nlibraries do not normally change. You do not relink a client application to pick up new IBM MQ client\nlibraries. The client picks up the new library next time the library is loaded by the client application. Do\nnot move libraries from their installed directory. Linking to libraries in anything other than their installed\ndirectory is an unsupported configuration.\nRelated concepts\n“Application compatibility and interoperability with earlier versions of IBM MQ” on page 384\n“Application compatibility and interoperability with later versions of IBM MQ” on page 385\nIBM MQ applications run against later versions of a queue manager without recoding, recompiling, or\nrelinking.

You must always\nupgrade an offline node with no online IBM MQ resources. In an Active/Passive configuration, if the node\nis Passive, you must ensure it cannot be switched to Active during the upgrade process.\nThe example, “Migrating a four-node MSCS cluster from an earlier version of the product to the latest\nversion” on page 420 , shows this procedure applied to a four-node cluster.\nProcedure\n1. Modify the possible owners of the IBM MQ resource to encompass only the Active node or nodes. With\nno owners assigned to Passive nodes, the IBM MQ resource that is being migrated cannot be activated.\n2. Ensure that the group containing the IBM MQ resource is currently on one of the nodes defined as a\npossible owner. The group must include any applications connecting to the queue manager resource.\n3. Stop the cluster service on the node being migrated. The MSCS cache is cleared of any IBM MQ DLLs\nthat have been registered.\n4. Migrate the selected node by following the standard instructions in “Migrating a queue manager to a\nlater version on Windows” on page 397 . Apply the required maintenance level.\n5. Start the cluster service on the selected node.\n6. On the next node to be migrated, ensure that the IBM MQ resources are offline.\n7. Remove this node from the list of possible owners. For clusters with more than two nodes, see the\nAdditional considerations later in this topic.\n8. Move the group containing the IBM MQ resource to one of the possible owners and bring it online.\n9. Repeat steps 3-8 as necessary for any remaining nodes.\nMigrating a four-node MSCS cluster from an earlier version of the product to the latest version\nThe example in Table 43 on page 421 illustrates the steps involved in migrating a four-node MSCS cluster.\nIn the example IBM MQ resources include queue managers, applications, and dependant MSCS\nresources, such as an IP address defined an as MSCS resource. In each step, the changes are italicized.\nStep 1\nSelect the node to migrate and prepare it for upgrading from an earlier version of the product to the\nlatest version.\n1. Select node 1 to be migrated and convert it into a Passive node with no running IBM MQ resources.\n2. Modify the possible owners of the group containing the IBM MQ resources, to encompass only the\nrequired online nodes. Failover does not attempt to switch IBM MQ resources to the node that is\nnot a possible owner. It is safe to migrate that node.\n3. Move the group containing the IBM MQ resource to one of the nodes that is a possible owner, and\nbring it online.\n4. Stop the cluster service on the node being migrated. Stopping the service clears the MSCS cache of\nany IBM MQ libraries that have been registered for MSCS.

You might identify each\nsubsystem as a queue manager by giving it the name QM xx (where xx is a unique identifier), or\nyou might choose a naming convention like ADDX , where A signifies the geographic area, DD signifies\nthe company division, and X is a unique identifier.\nYou might want to use your naming convention to distinguish between queue managers and queue\nsharing groups. For example, you might identify each queue sharing group by giving it the name QG\nxx (where xx is the unique identifier).\nChoosing names for objects\nQueues, processes, name lists, clusters, and topics can have names up to 48 characters long.\nChannels can have names up to 20 characters long and storage classes can have names up to 8\ncharacters long.\nIf possible, choose meaningful names within any constraints of your local conventions. Any structure\nor hierarchy within names is ignored by IBM MQ, however, hierarchical names can be useful for\nsystem management. You can also specify a description of the object when you define it to give more\ninformation about its purpose.\nEach object must have a unique name within its object type. However, each object type has a separate\nnamespace, so you can define objects of different types with the same name. For example, if a queue\nhas an associated process definition, it is a good idea to give the queue and the process the same\nname. It is also a good idea to give a transmission queue the same name as its destination queue\nmanager.\nYou could also use the naming convention to identify whether the object definition is private or\na global. For example, you could call a namelist project_group.global to indicate that the\ndefinition is stored on the shared repository.\nApplication queues\nChoosing names that describe the function of each queue helps you to manage these\nqueues more easily. For example, you might call a queue for inquiries about the company\npayroll payroll_inquiry . The reply-to queue for responses to the inquiries might be called\npayroll_inquiry_reply .\nYou can use a prefix to group related queues. This means that you can specify groups of queues for\nadministration tasks like managing security and using the dead-letter queue handler. For example, all\nthe queues that belong to the payroll application might be prefixed by payroll_ . You can then define\na single security profile to protect all queues with names beginning with this prefix.\nYou can also use your naming convention to indicate that a queue is a shared queue. For example, if\nthe payroll inquiry queue was a shared queue, you might call it payroll_inquiry.shared .\nStorage classes and coupling facility structures\nThe character set you can use when naming storage classes and coupling facility structures is limited\nto uppercase alphabetic and numeric characters. You should be systematic when choosing names for\nthese objects.\nStorage class names can be up to 8 characters long, and must begin with an alphabetic character. You\nwill probably not define many storage classes, so a simple name is sufficient. For example, a storage\nclass for IMS bridge queues could be called IMS .\nCoupling facility structure names can be up to 12 characters long, and must begin with an alphabetic\ncharacter. You could use the name to indicate something about the shared queues associated with the\ncoupling facility structure (that they all belong to one suite of applications for example). Remember\nthat in the coupling facility, the structure names are the IBM MQ name prefixed by the name of the\nqueue sharing group (padded to four characters with @ symbols).\nInstalling and migrating   273"}

You can also contact support to request a ++USERMOD.\nOther fixes on IBM MQ for z/OS are distinct fixes on particular parts. These fixes resolve specific issues,\nare not cumulative, and are made available as and when they are produced.\nPTFs are applied to and removed from the installed code using SMP/E. For more information about SMP/E,\nsee “Installing IBM MQ for z/OS” on page 268 and “z/OS installation overview” on page 269 and the\nappropriate Program Directory. For download links for the Program Directories, see IBM MQ for z/OS\nProgram Directory PDF files .\nApart from any exceptions documented with the PTFs, PTFs do not change the correct operation of IBM\nMQ, and are reversible. Nonetheless, you must check that the fixes have not changed the operation of\ncritical programs unexpectedly.\nApplying PTFs does not change the version, release, or maintenance level of the code. No queue manager\nmigration is required after applying maintenance. PTFs are grouped into Recommended Service Updates\nInstalling and migrating   333"}

On z/OS, AIX, Linux, and Windows, different queue managers can coexist on the same server\nand be associated with different installations.\nSingle installation queue manager coexistence on all platforms\nSingle installation queue manager coexistence is useful in development and production environments. In\ndevelopment environments, you can set up different queue manager configurations to support different\ndevelopment activities. You can also work with multiple queue manager configurations on a single server,\nconnected by channels, as if deployed on a network.\nIn production environments configuring multiple queue managers on a single server is less common.\nIt has no performance or functional advantage over a single queue manager configuration. Sometimes,\nyou must deploy multiple queue managers on server. It might be essential to meet the requirements\nof a particular software stack, governance, administration, or as a consequence of the consolidation of\nservers.\nQueue manager coexistence in a multi-installation\nMulti-installation queue manager coexistence is supported on AIX, Linux, and Windows, and z/OS.1\nWith multi-installation queue manager coexistence on the same server, you can run queue managers at\ndifferent commands levels on the same server. You can also run multiple queue managers at the same\ncommand level, but associate them with different installations.\nMulti-installation adds more flexibility to the coexistence of queue managers using a single installation.\nAny of the reasons behind running multiple queue managers, such as supporting different software\nstacks, might require different versions of IBM MQ.\nThe biggest benefit of multi-installation identified by early users, is in upgrading from one version of IBM\nMQ to another. Multi-installation makes upgrading less risky, less costly, and is more flexible in meeting\nthe migration needs of applications running on a server.\nThe key to migration flexibility is being able to install a new version alongside an existing installation; see\nFigure 8 on page 375 , which is extracted from “Migrating on AIX and Linux: side-by-side” on page 430 or\n“Migrating on Windows: side-by-side” on page 405 .\n1Do not confuse multi-installation queue manager coexistence with multi-instance queue managers.

Choose the location where you want MQIPT to be installed.\nCreate a new directory where you want MQIPT to be installed.\nFor example, on AIX and Linux, you might use the following command:\nmkdir /opt/mqipt/installation1\nWhen you unpack the MQIPT installation archive file, a directory called mqipt is created, and the\ninstallation files are placed in this directory. On Windows, the MQIPT installation archive file also\ncontains a directory called META-INF that contains files relating to code signature verification.\n3. Unpack the installation archive file into the MQIPT directory by using an appropriate tool for your\nplatform.\nNote: The tar command on AIX and Linux systems must be run as the root user when installing\nMQIPT. Failure to run the tar command as root is likely to result in \"permission denied\" errors.\nFor example, on a Linux platform, you might use the following commands, if the archive file was\ndownloaded to the /tmp directory:\ncd /opt/mqipt/installation1\nsu root\ntar xzvf /tmp/9.4.0.0-IBM-MQIPT-LinuxX64.tar.gz\n4. To increase security, set the file permissions for the installed files so that they are read-only:\n•\n On AIX and Linux systems, you can use the chmod command. For\nexample:\nchmod -R a-w /opt/mqipt/installation1/mqipt \n•\n On Windows platforms, right-click the installation directory and select Properties .\nYou can change the file permissions on the Security tab.\n5. If you subsequently receive error message MQCPE080 Unable to determine MQIPT\ninstallation directory , set the MQIPT_PATH environment variable to the absolute path of the\nMQIPT installation directory.\nYou do not normally have to set the PATH or CLASSPATH environment variables for MQIPT because\nthe installation includes a Java runtime environment (JRE). However, under some circumstances\n(for example, if you use symbolic links), MQIPT commands are unable to determine the installation\ndirectory. This can be corrected by setting the MQIPT_PATH environment variable.\nFor example, if your installation directory is /opt/mqipt/installation1/mqipt , you might use\nthe following commands:\nMQIPT_PATH=/opt/mqipt/installation1/mqipt\nexport MQIPT_PATH\nInstalling and migrating   287"}

The definitions are\ndescribed here. The following sections describe the various concepts associated with migration, followed\nby the various tasks needed; these tasks are platform-specific where needed.\n“Migrating IBM MQ” on page 353\nMigration is the conversion of programs and data to work with a new code level of IBM MQ. Some\ntypes of migration are required, and some are optional. Queue manager migration is never required after\napplying a maintenance level update, that does not change the command level. Some types of migration\nare automatic, and some are manual. Queue manager migration is typically automatic and required after\nreleases and manual and optional after a maintenance level upgrade that introduces a new function.\nApplication migration is typically manual and optional.\n“Upgrading IBM MQ” on page 336\nUpgrading is the process of taking an existing IBM MQ installation and upgrading to a new level of code.\nRelated information\nIBM MQ - SupportPacs by Product\nMigrating on Windows: single stage\nSingle-stage migration is the term used to describe replacing the only installation of IBM MQ on a server,\nwith a later version of the product. Single stage migration is also known as upgrading in place or in place\nupgrade . Single-stage migration preserves existing scripts and procedures for running IBM MQ the most.\nWith other migration scenarios you might change some scripts and procedures, but you can reduce the\neffect queue manager migration has on users.\nBefore you begin\nThese topics guide you in deciding what other tasks you must perform to migrate queue managers and\napplications to the later version. For the precise sequence of commands to upgrade a queue manager to\nthe later version, do the migration task for the platform you are interested in. All the tasks are listed by\nplatform in the links at the end of this topic. As part of the queue manager migration task, back up your\nexisting queue manager data. Even on a multi-installation server, queue managers cannot be restored to a\nprevious command level after migration.\nAttention: From IBM MQ 9.0, the ccsid_part2.tbl file replaces the existing ccsid.tbl file,\nused in previous versions of the product, to supply additional CCSID information.\nThe ccsid_part2.tbl file takes precedence over the ccsid.tbl file and:\n• Allows you to add or modify CCSID entries\n• Specify default data conversion\n• Specify data for different command levels\nThe ccsid_part2.tbl is applicable to the following platforms only:\n•\n Linux - all versions\n400   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Reversibility implies two\nthings:\n1. The previous level of code is fully restored.\n2. Changes that are made to IBM MQ objects are compatible. Changes are things like the creation or\ndeletion of persistent messages, changes to queue managers, channels, topics, and queues. New and\nmodified objects continue to work correctly with the restored level of code.\nThe reversibility of a maintenance package limits the extent of functional changes that are included in a\nmaintenance package. No irreversible changes are included in a maintenance package. But, reversibility\nhas limits. A maintenance package might include new programming and administrative interfaces. If\nyou build new or modified applications to use the new interfaces, those applications do not work if the\nmaintenance package is removed.\nOn a smaller scale, a fix pack, CSU, or interim fix might introduce a new configuration parameter to solve\na problem. If you remove the fix pack, CSU, or interim fix, although the new interface introduced by\nthe change is not available any more, IBM MQ works with any objects that have been changed by the\nconfiguration parameter. For example, a new Java system property might introduce a parameter to set\na code page for queue manager data conversion. The fix does not change any existing persistent queue\nmanager state information. It can be removed, and the queue manager continues to work as before, but\nwithout the capability introduced in the fix.\nOn different platforms, you employ different mechanisms to install and maintain software releases.\nInstalling a release at a new maintenance level, and applying maintenance level updates to update an\nearlier release to the same maintenance level, have different results.\nWhen you update the maintenance or fix level of IBM MQ by applying a regular maintenance level update,\nyou can reverse the update by removing the fix. When you update the maintenance or fix level of IBM\nMQ by applying a maintenance level update containing a new function, you can reverse that update and\nall previously reversible updates until a queue manager associated with the installation enables the new\nfunction.\nMaintenance levels and fix levels are both supplied from Fix Central. For information on where to\nfind direct links to specific fix packs, CSUs, and other IBM MQ resources on Fix Central, see IBM MQ\ndownloads .\nProcedure\n• To check the IBM MQ maintenance level:\n– Type the command dspmqver , or DSPMQMVER on IBM i. The returned messages include the three-\ndigit VRM or, if maintenance has been applied, the four-digit VRMF.\n– Use the REST API GET method.\n–\n View the queue manager property panel in IBM MQ Explorer .\n–\n Look at the CSQY000I message in the queue manager job log. This message is issued\nwhen the queue manager starts, and shows the release level and release type.\n• To apply or remove maintenance level updates, follow the appropriate links for the platforms that your\nenterprise uses.\nRelated concepts\n“Multi-installation queue manager coexistence on AIX, Linux, and Windows” on page 376\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ for AIX, Linux, and Windows on the same server. These IBM MQ\ncopies can be at the same or different version levels. This is called a multi-installation. Multi-installation is\nparticularly useful when you upgrade from one IBM MQ version to a later version, because it allows you to\nrun the earlier version alongside the later version.\n“Queue manager coexistence” on page 374\n294   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

It then\nshows how to use the sample programs to put a message onto a queue, and get the message from the\nqueue.\nThe example does not address any client security issues.

The distributed\nqueuing facility is also known as the channel initiator and the mover.\nYou must perform the following tasks to enable distributed queuing:\n• Choose which communications interface to use. This can be either, or both, of the following:\n– APPC (LU 6.2)\n– TCP/IP\n• Customize the distributed queuing facility and define the IBM MQ objects required.\n•Define access security.\n• Set up your communications. This includes setting up your TCPIP.DATA data set if you are using TCP/IP,\nLU names, and side information if you are using APPC. This is described in Setting up communication for\nz/OS .\nNaming conventions\nIt is advisable to establish a set of naming conventions when planning your IBM MQ systems. The names\nyou choose will probably be used on different platforms, so you should follow the convention for IBM MQ,\nnot for the particular platform.\nIBM MQ allows both uppercase and lowercase letters in names, and the names are case sensitive.\nHowever, some z/OS consoles fold names to uppercase, so do not use lowercase letters for names unless\nyou are sure that this will not happen.\nYou can also use numeric characters and the period (.), forward slash (/), underscore (_) and percent (%)\ncharacters. The percent sign is a special character to Security Server (previously known as RACF ® ), so do\nnot use it in names if you are using Security Server as your External Security Manager. Do not use leading\nor trailing underscore characters if you are planning to use the Operations and Control panels.\nFor more information, see Rules for naming IBM MQ objects .\nChoosing names for queue managers and queue sharing groups\nEach queue manager and queue sharing group within a network must have a unique name. Do\nnot use the same name for a queue manager and a queue sharing group. On z/OS the names of\nqueue managers and queue sharing groups can be up to four characters long. Each Db2 system and\ndata-sharing group within the network must also have a unique name.\nThe names of queue manager and queue sharing groups can use only uppercase alphabetic\ncharacters, numeric characters, and dollar sign ($), number sign (#) or at sign (@); they must not\nstart with a numeric character. Queue sharing group names that are less than four characters long are\npadded internally with at signs, so do not use names ending in the at sign.\n272   Installing and migrating IBM MQ"}

Set up remote connections to all the queue managers in each instance of IBM MQ Explorer.\nNote: From 1Q 2023, for Multiplatforms, there are two types of maintenance:\n• Fix packs, which contain roll-ups of all defects fixed since the previous fix pack delivery (or GA).\nFix packs are produced exclusively for Long Term Support (LTS) releases during their normal support\nlifecycle.\n• Cumulative security updates (CSUs), which are smaller updates and contain security patches released\nsince the previous maintenance (GA). CSUs are produced for LTS releases (including releases in\nextended support), and also for the latest IBM MQ Continuous Delivery (CD) release, as required to\ndeliver relevant security patches.\nFor maintenance releases in or after 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF represents either a fix pack\nnumber or a CSU number. Both types of maintenance are mutually cumulative (that is, they contain\neverything included in older CSUs and fix packs), and both are installed using the same mechanisms for\napplying maintenance. Both types of maintenance update the F-digit of the VRMF to a higher number than\nany previous maintenance: fix packs use \"F\" values divisible by 5, CSUs use \"F\" values not divisible by 5.\nFor maintenance releases before 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF always represents the fix pack\nlevel. For example, the first fix pack of the IBM MQ 9.3.0 LTS release is numbered 9.3.0.1.\nFor more information, see Changes to IBM MQ's maintenance delivery model .\nAbout this task\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ on a server to stage the release of IBM MQ maintenance level\nupdates. For example, as in the scenario that is described in the task steps, by using two installations\nto roll out maintenance level updates, you maintain two maintenance levels on a server, with the aim of\ngetting all queue managers and applications to the production maintenance level before replacing the\nprevious level of maintenance with the next level.\nWhich installation an application uses is driven by the queue manager that an application connects to.\nThe setmqm command associates a queue manager with an installation. You can associate a queue\nmanager with a different installation as long as the installation is at the same or higher command level.\nIn this scenario, all the installations are at the same command level. You can associate or reassociate a\nqueue manager with either of the installations running any of the fix packs or cumulative security updates\n(CSUs).\nInstalling and migrating   311"}

Only if it\nis important to pick up a fix in the IBM MQ link library itself, must you review the search path. Either you\nmust make the installation with the IBM MQ link library fix primary, or make a local adjustment for the\napplication, perhaps by running the setmqenv command.\nRunning commands is a different matter. Commands are always run from the primary installation, or the\ninstallation you have selected by running the setmqenv command. If you run a command from the wrong\ninstallation, the command fails.

To set up your configuration for this scenario, complete the following steps:\n1. Install two copies of IBM MQ. In this example, they are named Inst_1 and Inst_2 .\n2. Make Inst_1 primary by running setmqinst .\n3. Associate all the queue managers on the server with Inst_1 by running setmqm .\n4. Start all the queue managers on the server.\n5. Show and connect all direct connections with the queue managers associated with Inst_1 in IBM MQ\nExplorer.\n6. Set up remote connections to all the queue managers in each instance of IBM MQ Explorer.\nNote: From 1Q 2023, for Multiplatforms, there are two types of maintenance:\n• Fix packs, which contain roll-ups of all defects fixed since the previous fix pack delivery (or GA).\nFix packs are produced exclusively for Long Term Support (LTS) releases during their normal support\nlifecycle.\n• Cumulative security updates (CSUs), which are smaller updates and contain security patches released\nsince the previous maintenance (GA). CSUs are produced for LTS releases (including releases in\nextended support), and also for the latest IBM MQ Continuous Delivery (CD) release, as required to\ndeliver relevant security patches.\nFor maintenance releases in or after 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF represents either a fix pack\nnumber or a CSU number. Both types of maintenance are mutually cumulative (that is, they contain\neverything included in older CSUs and fix packs), and both are installed using the same mechanisms for\napplying maintenance. Both types of maintenance update the F-digit of the VRMF to a higher number than\nany previous maintenance: fix packs use \"F\" values divisible by 5, CSUs use \"F\" values not divisible by 5.\nFor maintenance releases before 1Q 2023, the fourth digit in the VRMF always represents the fix pack\nlevel. For example, the first fix pack of the IBM MQ 9.3.0 LTS release is numbered 9.3.0.1.\nFor more information, see Changes to IBM MQ's maintenance delivery model .\nAbout this task\nYou can install multiple copies of IBM MQ on a server to stage the release of IBM MQ maintenance level\nupdates. For example, as in the scenario that is described in the task steps, by using two installations\nto roll out maintenance level updates, you maintain two maintenance levels on a server, with the aim of\ngetting all queue managers and applications to the production maintenance level before replacing the\nprevious level of maintenance with the next level.\nWhich installation an application uses is driven by the queue manager that an application connects to.\nThe setmqm command associates a queue manager with an installation. You can associate a queue\nmanager with a different installation as long as the installation is at the same or higher command level.\nIn this scenario, all the installations are at the same command level. You can associate or reassociate a\nqueue manager with either of the installations running any of the fix packs or cumulative security updates\n(CSUs).\nIn this scenario, an application links to the primary installation. When it connects to a queue manager,\nIBM MQ switches the linkage to the installation associated with the queue manager; see “Multi-\ninstallation queue manager coexistence on AIX, Linux, and Windows” on page 376 .\nFor applications built with the link options described in the product documentation, the simplest way to\nconfigure the link library search path for IBM MQ applications is to make an installation primary.

You might be following a different build procedure tailored to your development\nenvironment, or adapted from a development tool.\n• How did you specify the load path for the earlier version?\n• Is the application is loaded by another environment, such as Eclipse, or an application server?

Identify the installation of the later version of the product, from which the operating system is going to\nload IBM MQ libraries:\n• If you have a multiple installations of the later versions to load from a server, IBM MQ checks that\nthe installation the library was loaded from is the installation that is associated with any queue\nmanager the application calls. IBM MQ loads the correct library if the wrong library is loaded. It is\nnecessary to configure only one runtime environment for all IBM MQ applications.\n• A typical choice is to set the primary installation. Setting an installation to be primary places\nsymbolic links to the IBM MQ libraries in /usr/lib . Applications built have an explicit link\nto /usr/lib ,and /usr/lib is also normally in the default library search path.\n• If you upgraded an earlier version installation to the later version, a link path to the earlier version\ninstallation now points to an installation containing the later version. Applications that have a fixed\nlinkage path to the earlier version installation now load the libraries for the later installation.

For each installation\nmedia (for example, each client and server), Instance ID 1 is the default ID which is used for single\ninstallations. If you want to install alongside Instance ID 1 you need to specify which instance you want\nto use.

Similarly, if instance 2 has been removed, you need to find out\nthat there is a gap that can be reused. You can find out which Instance ID is currently in use by using the\ndspmqinst command.\nProcedure\n1. Type dspmqinst to find a free MSI Instance in the media being installed by reviewing the MSIMedia\nand MSIInstanceId values for the versions already installed.

Each installation has a separate installation path. You can\nchoose where to install IBM MQ.\n5. IBM MQ resources have installation-scope resource isolation, so operations on one installation do not\naffect the others. This means that the resources created by one installation are isolated from those\ncreated by other installations. It enables actions, such as removing an installation of IBM MQ, while\nqueue managers are running under another installation.\n6. Queue managers are associated with an installation. You can move queue managers between\ninstallations at the same or higher version of IBM MQ, but you cannot migrate back to earlier releases.\nLocating installations on your system\nTo locate your installations, you can use the following methods:\n• Use the platform installation tools to query what is installed and where on the system\n• Use the dspmqver command to display IBM MQ version and build information.\n• Use the dspmqinst command to display installation entries from mqinst.ini .\n•\n On AIX and Linux, use the following command to list the installations:\ncat /etc/opt/mqm/mqinst.ini\n•\n On Windows, use the following command to query the registry:\nreg.exe query \"HKLM\\Software\\[Wow6432Node\\]IBM\\WebSphere MQ\\Installation\" /s\nWorking with multiple installations\nTo work with a queue manager, you need to use the commands from its installation. If you select the\nwrong installation, you see:\nAMQ5691: Queue manager 'MYQM' is associated with a different installation (Inst1)\nTo work with a queue manager, you have to use the control commands from its associated installation.\nYou have a choice of:\n• Using the full path to the control commands, for example:\n$ MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH\\bin\\strmqm MYQM\nor\n• Setting the environment variables for an installation with one of:\n$ MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/bin/setmqenv 's\n$ setmqenv -m MYQM\n$ setmqenv -n InstallationName\n$ setmqenv -p MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH\nInstalling and migrating   371"}

The logic\nthat does this is run at installation, upgrade, modification, and fix pack installation time.\nYou might find that, due to the increased security, you are unable to do certain things exactly the same\nway you used to do them. For example:\n• An MQ Administrator (who is not also a member of the Administrators group) can no longer edit or\nrecompile the sample programs in the Tools subdirectory. If you wish to do this, take a copy of the\ndirectory (or the portions you are interested in) and change your copies of the build scripts to reflect the\nnew location.\nIn normal use, however, you should be unaware of the change, except for the little extra time required by\nthe installer to make the changes. During this period the message Initializing security... will be\ndisplayed. A similar short pause will occur when installing the fix pack files or applying a patch.\nThe update of the security writes a log ( amqidsec-< Installationname >.txt ) to the TEMP directory\non the machine. If you see the main install failing in custom action 'iwiLaunchAmqidsec', you should\nconsult this file.\nFirst-time installations\nWhen you install IBM MQ for the first time, you can accept default installation locations. You can also\nselect the custom installation option by choosing the location for the IBM MQ binary files, and the location\nfor the IBM MQ data and logs.\nFrom IBM MQ 8.0, the default location for the program binary files is different from the default location for\nthe data files.\nTable 41. Default program and data directory locations on different versions of IBM MQ on Windows\nIBM MQ version IBM MQ program binary files\ninstallation locationIBM MQ data files location\nIBM WebSphere MQ 7.5 Program and data files are in one location: C:\\Program Files\n(x86)\\IBM\\WebSphere MQ\nIBM MQ 8.0 C:\\Program\nFiles\\IBM\\WebSphere MQC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ\nIBM MQ 9.0 and later C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\MQ C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ\nSubsequent installations and reinstallations\nAfter the data directory is specified, during the installation process of any installation, it cannot be\nchanged for subsequent installations. IBM MQ is only installed as a 64-bit version when it is installed on a\n64-bit operating system.\nFor IBM MQ 9.0 and later, the default data directory is C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ , unless a version of\nthe product was previously installed, in which case the new installation continues to use the existing data\ndirectory.\nInstalling and migrating   395"}
