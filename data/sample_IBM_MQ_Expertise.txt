IBM MQ is a messaging middleware that enables applications to communicate reliably.
A Queue Manager handles channels, queues, logs, and message persistence.
Clusters allow workload balancing across multiple queue managers.
Channels such as SVRCONN, SENDER, and RECEIVER provide connectivity.
Dead-letter queues store undeliverable messages for later analysis.
AMQ9510: Messages cannot be delivered because the channel is inactive.
To resolve this error, restart the channel using: START CHANNEL(channel-name)
Buffer pool tuning is critical on z/OS when MQ message rates exceed 50k/sec.
